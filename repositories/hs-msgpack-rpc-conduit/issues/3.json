Add an export list to the `Internal` module, because you're going to export that module now, and we don't want to expose more than necessary. You may need to restructure things a bit, because currently the `Internal` module is written with the idea that it won't be exposed in the library. E.g. we still want the `Connection` type to be opaque.\n3. Add a comment to the top of the now exposed `Internal` module that its API is unstable (in reality, the rest of the API is also unstable until release 1.0, but for internal stuff it makes sense to be more explicit about it).\n",
