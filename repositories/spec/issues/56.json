    "body": "Reading the spec I have a few more questions. I'll combine them into a single issue since they are related.\r\n\r\nThe spec says that nodes for onion path include DHT nodes and TCP relays. Can someone clarify how many nodes does Tox keep in memory or somewhere else to choose from while building a new onion path? There is quite a lot of numbers specifying timeouts, but this information seems to be missing. I'm asking because this it is very important to have a huge number of known nodes that are not yet connected to each other (meaning they are unlikely to be started by the same person, which is the case while we traverse deeper into DHT), but this will require a lot of time/bandwidth. In BitTorrent DHT it is less of an issue, but in Tox this is a crucial piece used for anonymity.\r\n\r\nThe next part is probably because I'm lacking some general understanding of onion routing at the moment, but I'd be thankful for clarification or links to relevant specifications.\r\n\r\nSo when selecting the nodes for future onion path, the node should connect to them and share public keys with each node that is going to be a part of the future onion.\r\nIf this is the case, how does this happens exactly?\r\n\r\nAlso since we are connecting directly to those nodes prior to constructing onion path this should reveal a lot of information about future onion path to someone who is eavesdropping our Internet connection.\r\n\r\nFeel free to point me at specific sections of the spec if I'm missing something obvious.",

In the current implementation, after an \ninitial bootstrapping phase, the nodes we use when constructing onion \npaths are those which reply to our onion requests. This is not at all \na good approach, as is acknowledged by a comment in the code:\n\n\"\"\"\n// TODO(irungentoo): remove this and find a better source of nodes to use for paths.\nonion_add_path_node(onion_c, ip_port, public_key);\n\"\"\"\n\nSee also https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/547 .\n\nDo you have any suggestions for good ways to choose nodes?\n\nOne possibility is to pick a random point in the DHT and find some nodes \nclose to it, and on paths from us to it. This is called a \"fake friend\" \nin tox. It's how the initial bootstrapping phase I mentioned above \nworks, and is what I was thinking of using for #547. But close nodes \ncould well be conspiring, so we should be careful with this.\n",
