            "body": "Just a matter of personal opinion of course, but this repo is the focal point for Python for Tox. I tried the old C bindings back then and I think I got them to work, but replacing them with incomplete Cython bindings meant there have been no complete supported Python bindings for the project for 2 years. But the README (still) doesn't tell the user that the Cython bindings are incomplete so you waste a told of time trying them out. \r\n\r\nIMHO, it would have been better to adopt into the main TokTok project the\r\nctypes bindings from [PyTox](https://github.com/aitjcize/PyTox) https://github.com/toxygen-project/toxygen/tree/next_gen/toxygen/wrapper and maintained them so that the project had _visible_ support for Python. That code supported NGC groups and only needed a little fixing for API changes. Maybe having the wrapper in the core project would have kept the toxygen project alive - it's a GUI that supports NGC groups.\r\n\r\nIn my version I fixed the API changes and I've added a fair amount of error reporting, and it's stable because the Tox API is stable; ctypes is efficient. Plus I added an (incomplete) integration test suite https://github.com/TokTok/py-toxcore-c/issues/79 which I'm sure would benefit from your review. As the runner is proxy-aware It's makes a good testrunner of Tox in Tor.  \r\n\r\nPS: there are automatic ctypes generators (I haven't tried) which might make keeping the code uptodate easier: https://github.com/ctypesgen/ctypesgen\r\nhttps://github.com/albertz/PyCParser I think ctypesgen generates type declarations which is really nice, but my wrapper is typed anyway.
