Doing this gives us two advantages:\n+\n+1.  The operating system specific code is factored out, and none of the\n+    implementation files `#include`s system headers other than libc and\n+    library dependencies (opus, vpx).\n+2.  None of the toxcore code performs any system calls directly, without going\n+    through this layer.\n+\n+The first advantage allows us to test the OS-specific code independently from\n+the portable code. Once we validated that the I/O code does I/O the right way,\n+we can assume correctness and no longer need to test it through toxcore as\n+thoroughly as before. We'll still want integration tests that test toxcore's\n+integration with this layer, but most functional tests can become pure non-I/O\n+tests. This will give an immense speedup of tests, improving developer\n+velocity.\n+\n+The second point allows us to record exactly what system calls toxcore makes,\n+together with the system's responses, in an execution trace. We can then later\n+replay this trace to reproduce bugs. We can also use stored execution traces\n+to ensure that toxcore behaves the same for the same input.\n+\n+Not only can we reproduce the exact same code execution, but we can also\n+modify it slightly. This allows us to simulate arbitrary error conditions.\n+Perhaps most interestingly, since `malloc` is potentially a system call, we\n+will include it in the mock layer, allowing us to repeatedly execute the same\n+trace, each time with an increasing number of successful mallocs. This allows\n+us to test a large number of possible allocation failure handling paths, much\n+more precisely than we would by just setting process resource limits.\n+\n+# Requirements\n+\n+Requirements for the solution:\n+\n+*   It should include *all* potential system calls, including libsodium/nacl\n+    random functions such as key generation.\n+*   It should not add more than 50ns of latency to actual system calls when\n+    not recording or replaying a trace. The `gettimeofday` system call on\n+    Linux takes about 50ns, so we take that as a benchmark.\n+*   Recording a trace should be sufficiently low overhead such that we can\n+    record the trace of a multimedia (A/V) call without noticable delay.\n+*   It should be able to record toxcore API calls, so that we can replay the\n+    activity of any API user without having to manually reproduce the API\n+    calls that led to the execution.\n+*   The remainder of the code, i.e. everything except the OS layer, should no\n+    longer contain any platform-specific code. This includes LAN discovery\n+    code.\n+\n+Specifically the LAN discovery code contains larger platform-specific\n+functions that will need to move into the platform module.\n+\n+This proposal makes toxcore itself deterministic.

Doing this gives us two advantages:\n+\n+1.  The operating system specific code is factored out, and none of the\n+    implementation files `#include`s system headers other than libc and\n+    library dependencies (opus, vpx).\n+2.  None of the toxcore code performs any system calls directly, without going\n+    through this layer.\n+\n+The first advantage allows us to test the OS-specific code independently from\n+the portable code. Once we validated that the I/O code does I/O the right way,\n+we can assume correctness and no longer need to test it through toxcore as\n+thoroughly as before. We'll still want integration tests that test toxcore's\n+integration with this layer, but most functional tests can become pure non-I/O\n+tests. This will give an immense speedup of tests, improving developer\n+velocity.\n+\n+The second point allows us to record exactly what system calls toxcore makes,\n+together with the system's responses, in an execution trace. We can then later\n+replay this trace to reproduce bugs. We can also use stored execution traces\n+to ensure that toxcore behaves the same for the same input.\n+\n+Not only can we reproduce the exact same code execution, but we can also\n+modify it slightly. This allows us to simulate arbitrary error conditions.\n+Perhaps most interestingly, since `malloc` is potentially a system call, we\n+will include it in the mock layer, allowing us to repeatedly execute the same\n+trace, each time with an increasing number of successful mallocs. This allows\n+us to test a large number of possible allocation failure handling paths, much\n+more precisely than we would by just setting process resource limits.\n+\n+# Requirements\n+\n+Requirements for the solution:\n+\n+*   It should include *all* potential system calls, including libsodium/nacl\n+    random functions such as key generation.\n+*   It should not add more than 50ns of latency to actual system calls when\n+    not recording or replaying a trace. The `gettimeofday` system call on\n+    Linux takes about 50ns, so we take that as a benchmark.\n+*   Recording a trace should be sufficiently low overhead such that we can\n+    record the trace of a multimedia (A/V) call without noticable delay.\n+*   It should be able to record toxcore API calls, so that we can replay the\n+    activity of any API user without having to manually reproduce the API\n+    calls that led to the execution.\n+*   The remainder of the code, i.e. everything except the OS layer, should no\n+    longer contain any platform-specific code. This includes LAN discovery\n+    code.\n+\n+Specifically the LAN discovery code contains larger platform-specific\n+functions that will need to move into the platform module.\n+\n+This proposal makes toxcore itself deterministic.

So far you have talked about mocking system calls by providing an IO interface called `Env`, which would provide implementations for such system calls as memory allocation, time, network stack, probably also sleep, etc., but now you seem to be talking about providing Tox API mocking/tracing, so that you would know which toxcore API functions, with which arguments and at what time a client calls. You are no longer talking about system call mocking, which is what the title of this proposal. Perhaps change the title a little and elaborate more on how the API tracing would be done?\n\n---\n\n*[toktok/designs/osmock.md, line 137 at r2](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/toktok/website/83#-L7ID6O5SW0g_yLg7-IC:-L7ID6O5SW0g_yLg7-ID:ba359be) ([raw file](https://github.com/toktok/website/blob/8d96afd774b570686b63f2fa045983865fe9e0ec/toktok/designs/osmock.md#L137)):*\n> ```Markdown\n> doesn't need to mock malloc and random number generators, but injects\n> hstox-generated network messages into the receive queue of the system under\n> test (i.e. toxcore).

But all it can use to do this injection is the toxcore's system call mock, no?
