Currently, hs-toxcore has an almost empty README, making it hard to understand the status of hs-toxcore.\r\n\r\nCould you please write \"Work-in-Progress Haskell Tox implementation.\" or \"Haskell Tox implementation (Alpha)\" or something like that? If it's fully ready, then a small indication of that would also help readers a lot (I think)\r\n\r\nThanks for considering! Personally, I don't know myself, otherwise I'd write a PR.",
