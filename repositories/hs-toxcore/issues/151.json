Remind me which century this is?\n\n* More often, it's \"them\", which isn't too bad, except that \"themselves\" is\n  often used for a single peer, which is confusing. I would either use \"it\"\n  for the peer, or use \"themself\".\n\n* Tense and modality are used inconsistently - sometimes an implementation\n  \"will\" do something, often it \"does\" it, and occasionally it \"should\" or\n  \"must\" do it. We should decide whether this is describing the behaviour of\n  current implementations, in which case present tense \"does\" seems best to\n  me, or whether it is defining a conforming implementation, in which case use\n  of \"may\", \"should\", and \"must\" as in RFCs would be appropriate.\n\n* There should be a typographical convention for introducing a definition. I\n  favour bold text, as in \"A *gostak* is a distimmer of doshes\".\n\n* \"group\", \"groupchat\" and \"group chat\" are used interchangeably; we should\n  replace them all with \"conference\".",
