    "body": "Currently, a large majority of the traffic in the tox network is generated by\npinging onion nodes with Onion Request packets, which a node does to keep\nitself announced and to check for friends coming online. This PR significantly\nreduces the rate at which such requests are sent.\n\nIn part this is by fixing some bugs; probably most significantly, previously\nthe nodes for friends were always considered timed out when we came to ping\nthem, since the timeout for announce nodes was used for the check rather than\nthat for friend nodes, leading to some extra traffic.\n\nThen it implements two schemes for reducing unnecessary pinging. The first is\nto start to trust slightly announce nodes and paths which have been alive for a\nwhile, and not ping them so aggressively - while reverting to the old behaviour\nat the first sign of failure. Based on my testing, this reducing announce\ntraffic by around a factor of 4, from around 2 packets per second to around\n~0.5, with no discernable problems.\n\nThe second is to gradually reduce the rate of pinging we do to check on offline\nfriends when they've been offline for some time. Since some users typically\nhave many offline friends, this should result in a large reduction in traffic.\n\nThis last should be the only change which could cause any problems for users.\nThe principal effect is on friend requests: if we make a friend request\nto an offline node, and it remains offline for some time while we stay online,\nthen when it comes online it may take longer for it to receive the friend\nrequest. With the constants as I've set them, the extreme case is that they\nstay offline for at least 1600 minutes, and then the request will take\nsomething like 5 minutes on average to get through. The same delay applies to\nestablished friends who come online after being offline for a while and who\nsomehow fail to find our announcement - that shouldn't happen, but possibly it\nsometimes does (and an attacker can cause it by poisoning our announcement\nneighbourhood).\n\nPlease note when testing this PR that you shouldn't expect to see a huge\nbandwidth reduction - what you should see if you packet-sniff is a reduction\n(after your node has been up for a while) in Onion Request packets (first byte\n0x80), but it needs a large proportion of the network to adopt it before we'll\nstart to see actual significant bandwidth reduction.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n---\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/toktok/c-toxcore/542)\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",

I've increased the timeout from 19s to 75s,\r\nwhich is enough to make false positives very unlikely.

How \n>I understand that PR it would fix bandwidth issues on mobile, right ?\n\nIt should help a lot, but tox will always use a fair amount of \nbandwidth. Making up numbers which might be way off, I guess this should \nget it down to around 2-3KBps in each direction when idling, and with \nmore work (optimising DHT traffic, and making sure we only send good \nnodes in response to onion requests) I have the impresion that as low as \n1 could be feasible. I don't know if that's good enough for mobile \nusers.\n",

The problem is not that tox uses the DHT on mobile, the problem is the DHT is dumb. I smart DHT protocol should be able to bootstrap, and find and connect to ALL online friends in under 5s. Creating and validating onion routes is one of the things that makes this hard to do. So any optimizations of onion routing is a good place to start. (A part from dropping the onion for announce/friend finding)",

Once things are settled, traffic for friend searching \nis something like ~0.01 per offline friend. But rates are much higher at \nfirst. What this means on average depends on how many offline friends \nusers have and how long their nodes stay online, but let's estimate the \naverage total request rate as 1 packet per second. Each request, \nassuming the packet doesn't get dropped anywhere along the way, \ngenerates\n403+395+387+354+416+357+298+238=2848 bytes\n(packet kinds 80-83,8c-8e,84; sizes including headers as reported by \ntcpdump) of traffic through the network. But in fact I observe that only \naround half of requests sent get a response, probably mostly due to the \ntarget being behind an evil NAT, making the average traffic per request\n403+395+387+354 + ((416+357+298+238)/2)=2193.5 bytes\nNow with the recent DHT fix, my node generates ~1.3 nodes requests per \nsecond, each costing 113+238=351 bytes. Other packet kinds seem to be \nnegligible. So that adds up to\n(1.3*351 + 1*2193.5)/1024 = 2.6KBps\nin each direction.\n\nNow this calculation assumed that everyone participates properly in the \nnetwork, while in fact we have many TCP-only leeches and many behind \nevil NATs which make them unusable by the onion (Restricted Cone or \nSymmetric), and it doesn't take into account lossy network conditions \nsome nodes may operate under. So maybe a better estimate is ~5KBps in \neach direction for those fully participating in the onion.\n\nAll very rough, could be significantly off in either direction. A lower \nbound, considering only DHT and announce traffic, would be\n(1.3*351 + 0.5*2193.5)/1024 = 1.5KBps.\n\n>> and with more work (optimising DHT traffic, and making sure we only \n>> send good nodes in response to onion requests) I have the impresion \n>> that as low as 1 could be feasible.

But if we're to \nparticipate fairly in the network rather than leeching off it, we must \nrespond promptly to any packets coming in. So we oughtn't expect to be \nable to sleep and yet remain announced.\n",
