Whether your team is comparing changes in a pull request or reviewing a single commit, Codecov will improve the code review workflow and quality.\r\n\r\n## Code coverage done right.®\r\n\r\n1. Upload coverage reports from your CI builds.\r\n2. Codecov merges all builds and languages into one beautiful coherent report.\r\n3. Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups.

Doesn't Zig have a way to link against a C library that was already built with autotools/bazel/cmake? There shouldn't be a need to add a Zig build system for that.\r\n\r\nIs someone re-implementing toxcore in Zig? Could you link that project? Also, I don't see how having toxcore being built using a Zig build system would be any different than building it using autotools/bazel/cmake, and what role does a build system even have in testing the resulting toxcore binary against another toxcore implementation? One would typically write a separate testing program for that, independent of the build system, instead of coding it as a part of a build system.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere should be a very compelling reason for adding yet another build system and I have yet to see any compelling reason being mentioned.\r\n\r\nToxcore already uses 3 build systems: autotools, bazel and cmake, which I think is already a bit too much. Having to maintain 4 of them doesn't help the situation. Each build system is a maintenance burden and it quickly adds up, to the point that changing something non-trivial in the build process of toxcore would require knowing autotools, bazel, cmake and now zig, which I'm not sure if we even have a person who knows all 4 of those. We shouldn't be adding a yet another build system without a good reason.\r\n\r\nIf a Zig build system brings something desirable to toxcore that none of the other build systems toxcore uses do, then it might be worth considering. But if it's no better than the 3 build systems toxcore already uses, then what is the point?\r\n\r\nThen there is also the question if any of the regular contributors know Zig and if any of them would be willing to maintain this Zig build system. If it goes unmaintained once it gets merged, then what is the point?",

            "body": "This PR got some thumb-ups, so I assume those who left them consider the Zig build system to be somehow desirable, yet somehow no one managed to provide a reason of why we want toxcore to support a 4th build system, either on here on github or in the chat.\r\n\r\nSince I don't know anything about Zig, I done some reading to learn more about it.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>(A couple of paragraphs on the Zig C/C++ (cross-)compiler, which I found interesting and which I initially thought was the reason for the `build.zig` inclusion, but later realized that not being the case, so they can be skipped.)\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDuring the reading, I have stumbled upon this post: [`zig cc`: a Powerful Drop-In Replacement for GCC/Clang](https://andrewkelley.me/post/zig-cc-powerful-drop-in-replacement-gcc-clang.html) by the Zig programming language author/designer. It turns out that a distribution of Zig includes a clang-based C compiler that can be invoked as `zig cc`, accepting clang options as it's essentially a wrapper for clang. However, unlike your typical clang, Zig bundles Linux kernel headers, and binaries and headers of: glibc, musl and mingw-w64, for many different architectures: aarch64, arm, i386, mips, powerpc, riscv, x86_64, etc., and it does so for many different versions of glibc and musl libc. This allows `zig cc` to easily cross-compile any C project to one of numerous ABIs it supports (over 40), for example `riscv64-linux-musl`, `aarch64-windows-gnu` or `x86_64-windows-gnu`, as well as target a specific versions of the libc, like `x86_64-linux-gnu.2.25` for glibc 2.25. So using `zig cc` saves a lot of trouble of downloading/building separate cross-compilers for every ABI, having the Linux headers, glibc, musl libc, mingw-w64, etc. for the ABI you want to target installed, etc. -- all you need is just to download zig, run `zig cc foo.c -o foo.exe --target x86_64-windows-gnu` and you get your C code cross-compiled to Windows without having anything extra installed besides zig as zig is fully statically compiled and includes everything needed for the cross-compilation. You can even run it on Windows to create Linux binaries. It also works with C++ code via `zig c++`. It's pretty much a portable cross-compiler for C/C++ code, and it's also very light as it does some clever deduplication to reduce all the Linux headers, glibc, musl libc and mingw-w64, (and Zig itself also ships mostly as source code that is compiled and cached at runtime), to the point that its tarball takes 45 MiB according to the post.\r\n\r\nSo Zig is great for cross-compiling C/C++ code. One can use the Zig clang-based compiler by setting `CC=\"zig cc -target foo-bar-abi\"` `CXX=\"zig c++ -target foo-bar-abi\"` and invoking the existing autotools/bazel/cmake build system. If the project has dependencies, and toxcore does: sodium, opus, vpx, config, cmp -- those, and all of their dependencies, also need to be cross-compiled the same way, i.e. using the Zig C compiler (this is not specific to Zig, that's just how cross-compiling works).\r\n\r\n---\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nWhile the Zig C compiler is a neat feature of Zig, using it doesn't necessitate the addition of `build.zig`, i.e. it doesn't require one to use the Zig build system in any way, it works just fine with the existing build systems toxcore uses. The only reasons to add a `build.zig` to a C project that I see are:\r\n\r\n1. If you simply want to use the Zig build system to build your C project (perhaps that's your only build system instead of the 4th? :D)\r\n2. If you want other projects using the Zig build system, be it C, C++ or Zig-native projects, to be able to easily add your project as a dependency to their Zig build system. ([Since many C/C++ projects don't provide a `build.zig`, developers using the Zig build system for their project with C/C++ dependencies tend to maintain forks of those C/C++ dependencies, e.g. ffmpeg, harfbuzz, freetype, etc. with `build.zig` added as the build system](https://devlog.hexops.com/2023/mach-ecosystem-c-libraries/)).\r\n\r\nSo this PR -- the addition of the Zig build system -- doesn't provide any benefits to toxcore over the existing autotools/bazel/cmake, this PR is more about providing benefits to the downstream projects that use the Zig build system and want to use toxcore. Also, this PR links only against sodium, cmp, pthreads and gtest, it doesn't link against opus, vpx and config, so it builds only the base toxcore library, not toxav or tox-bootrstrap, so there is more work that needs to be done to build the toxcore project in its entirety using the Zig build system. What is more, opus, vpx and config don't provide `build.zig`, so we would either have to write our own Zig build systems for those, or use someone else's if someone else has already done the work of writing `build.zig`, i.e. instead of pulling the project from https://github.com/xiph/opus, we would be pulling it from some fork https://github.com/some-random-person/opus-zigbuild, which would obviously need to be audited and pinned to the audited version, and every time we version bump the dependency, it would need to be re-audited again... In fact, this PR already does this with winpthreads and gtest -- it builds them from the forks https://github.com/kassane/winpthreads-zigbuild and https://github.com/nodecum/gtest-zig instead of the original trusted repositories/sources. (I wonder if those were audited?)\r\n\r\nAccepting this PR would result in a lot of work of getting the rest of toxcore dependencies Zig-ified, and then continuously making sure that our `build.zig` of those dependencies match what the upstream's build system does, or continuously auditing someone else's `build.zig` and the accompanied patched source code (I noticed winpthreads-zigbuild not only adds the `build.zig` but also patches the source code...). If you (@freylax) would be maintaining this `build.zig` in the [zig-toxcore-c](https://github.com/TokTok/zig-toxcore-c) anyway, I can see why you would want to have it reside in this repository instead, but this dependency stuff is just a bit too crazy.\r\n\r\nIf some Tox/TokTok developer is willing to take the responsibility for maintaining it, and do it properly -- actually audit the`buid.zig` forks used for dependencies as they are a lot less trusted than the original projects, then I guess fine. In the worst case we could just remove it if it gets unmaintained. But personally I'm not very thrilled about this PR.",
