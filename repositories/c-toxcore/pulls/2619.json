    "body": "A few advantages:\r\n\r\n- They are definitely going to be `int` typed in C (and also in C++, because we use `constexpr` there, which in C23 we will be able to use as well).\r\n- It enforces that the values used in the definition are actually present at the definition site. There were a few macros whose values were not `#include`d, making their use a bit confusing: you have to include the header that the macro depends on yourself.\r\n- Implied from above, the modules checker won't tell you to include headers that contain the macros used in a macro definition.\r\n- It enforces single definition. In C, macros can be redefined if they are exactly the same. We had a few redundant definitions that I've now removed.\r\n- The name becomes a name rather than an expansion of some possibly complex expression, helping error messages.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages:\r\n\r\n- Custom syntax, because `enum{}` can't be used in C++, because doing arithmetic on unrelated `enum{}`s is deprecated.\r\n- Implied from the above, there's less syntax highlighting for `constant` than for `#define`. `enum{}` would have been nice, because it also groups constants together, but C++ complains.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n- - -\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/TokTok/c-toxcore/2619)\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",

Whether your team is comparing changes in a pull request or reviewing a single commit, Codecov will improve the code review workflow and quality.\r\n\r\n## Code coverage done right.®\r\n\r\n1. Upload coverage reports from your CI builds.\r\n2. Codecov merges all builds and languages into one beautiful coherent report.\r\n3. Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups. [Learn more here](\r\nhttp://docs.codecov.io/docs/flags)\r\n\r\nThrough **Codecov's Browser Extension** reports overlay directly in GitHub UI to assist in code review in [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecov/gedikamndpbemklijjkncpnolildpbgo) or Firefox (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/codecov/)\r\n\r\n*Highly detailed* **pull request comments** and *customizable* **commit statuses** will improve your team's workflow and code coverage incrementally.\r\n\r\n**File backed configuration** all through the `codecov.yml`. \r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n- Do you **merge multiple uploads** to the same commit? **Yes**\r\n- Do you **support multiple languages** in the same project? **Yes**\r\n- Can you **group coverage reports** by project and/or test type? **Yes**\r\n- How does **pricing** work?
