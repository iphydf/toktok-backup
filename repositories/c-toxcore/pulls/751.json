            "diff_hunk": "@@ -0,0 +1,595 @@\n+GNU General Public License\n+==========================\n+\n+_Version 3, 29 June 2007_\n+_Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<http://fsf.org/>&gt;_\n+\n+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\n+document, but changing it is not allowed.\n+\n+## Preamble\n+\n+The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other\n+kinds of works.\n+\n+The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away\n+your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public\n+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a\n+program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free\n+Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it\n+applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to\n+your programs, too.\n+\n+When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General\n+Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\n+copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source\n+code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\n+it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n+\n+To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or\n+asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if\n+you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to\n+respect the freedom of others.\n+\n+For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,\n+you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make\n+sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these\n+terms so they know their rights.\n+\n+Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: **(1)** assert\n+copyright on the software, and **(2)** offer you this License giving you legal permission\n+to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n+\n+For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is\n+no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL\n+requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not\n+be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n+\n+Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of\n+the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally\n+incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The\n+systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n+use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed\n+this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems\n+arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to\n+those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of\n+users.\n+\n+Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should\n+not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose\n+computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents\n+applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the\n+GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n+\n+The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n+\n+## TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+### 0. Definitions\n+\n+“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n+\n+“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n+works, such as semiconductor masks.\n+\n+“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n+License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and\n+“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\n+\n+To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in\n+a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The\n+resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a\n+work “based on” the earlier work.\n+\n+A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on\n+the Program.\n+\n+To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without\n+permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under\n+applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private\n+copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),\n+making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n+\n+To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n+parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer\n+network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n+\n+An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the\n+extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that **(1)**\n+displays an appropriate copyright notice, and **(2)** tells the user that there is no\n+warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that\n+licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this\n+License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n+menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n+\n+### 1. Source Code\n+\n+The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n+making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a\n+work.\n+\n+A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official\n+standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces\n+specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among\n+developers working in that language.\n+\n+The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than\n+the work as a whole, that **(a)** is included in the normal form of packaging a Major\n+Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and **(b)** serves only to\n+enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard\n+Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.\n+A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component\n+(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which\n+the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code\n+interpreter used to run it.\n+\n+The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the\n+source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object\n+code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However,\n+it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or\n+generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those\n+activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\n+includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and\n+the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work\n+is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or\n+control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n+\n+The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate\n+automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n+\n+The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n+\n+### 2. Basic Permissions\n+\n+All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the\n+Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License\n+explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The\n+output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,\n+given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights\n+of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n+\n+You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without\n+conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered\n+works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively\n+for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you\n+comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\n+control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so\n+exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit\n+them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship\n+with you.\n+\n+Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions\n+stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n+\n+### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law\n+\n+No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any\n+applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty\n+adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention\n+of such measures.\n+\n+When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of\n+technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising\n+rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any\n+intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,\n+against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention\n+of technological measures.\n+\n+### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies\n+\n+You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any\n+medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n+appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and\n+any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep\n+intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of\n+this License along with the Program.\n+\n+You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer\n+support or warranty protection for a fee.\n+\n+### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions\n+\n+You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from\n+the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that\n+you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+* **a)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a\n+relevant date.\n+* **b)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this\n+License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the\n+requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\n+* **c)** You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who\n+comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any\n+applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n+regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the\n+work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have\n+separately received it.\n+* **d)** If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal\n+Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display\n+Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n+\n+A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are\n+not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with\n+it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution\n+medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting\n+copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n+beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate\n+does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n+\n+### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms\n+\n+You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and\n+5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the\n+terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n+\n+* **a)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\n+physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a\n+durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n+* **b)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\n+physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least\n+three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for\n+that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either **(1)** a copy of\n+the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this\n+License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for\n+a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of\n+source, or **(2)** access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no\n+charge.\n+* **c)** Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to\n+provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and\n+noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in\n+accord with subsection 6b.\n+* **d)** Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for\n+a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way\n+through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy\n+the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object\n+code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server\n+(operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities,\n+provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find\n+the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,\n+you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy\n+these requirements.\n+* **e)** Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform\n+other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being\n+offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n+\n+A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the\n+Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the\n+object code work.\n+\n+A “User Product” is either **(1)** a “consumer product”, which\n+means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or\n+household purposes, or **(2)** anything designed or sold for incorporation into a\n+dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases\n+shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a\n+particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of\n+that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way\n+in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the\n+product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has\n+substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n+the only significant mode of use of the product.\n+\n+“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,\n+procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute\n+modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of\n+its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued\n+functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with\n+solely because modification has been made.\n+\n+If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for\n+use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which\n+the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient\n+in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is\n+characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be\n+accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if\n+neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code\n+on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n+\n+The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to\n+continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been\n+modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been\n+modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself\n+materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules\n+and protocols for communication across the network.\n+\n+Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with\n+this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an\n+implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no\n+special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n+\n+### 7. Additional Terms\n+\n+“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this\n+License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional\n+permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they\n+were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable\n+law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be\n+used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n+this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n+\n+When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any\n+additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional\n+permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you\n+modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a\n+covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n+\n+Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a\n+covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)\n+supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n+\n+* **a)** Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of\n+sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n+* **b)** Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author\n+attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works\n+containing it; or\n+* **c)** Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that\n+modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the\n+original version; or\n+* **d)** Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the\n+material; or\n+* **e)** Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,\n+trademarks, or service marks; or\n+* **f)** Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone\n+who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of\n+liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions\n+directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n+\n+All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further\n+restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received\n+it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License\n+along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a\n+license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying\n+under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of\n+that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such\n+relicensing or conveying.\n+\n+If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in\n+the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those\n+files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n+\n+Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a\n+separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply\n+either way.\n+\n+### 8. Termination\n+\n+You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under\n+this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will\n+automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses\n+granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n+\n+However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a\n+particular copyright holder is reinstated **(a)** provisionally, unless and until the\n+copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and **(b)** permanently,\n+if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n+prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n+\n+Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently\n+if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this\n+is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any\n+work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n+your receipt of the notice.\n+\n+Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of\n+parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your\n+rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to\n+receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n+\n+### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies\n+\n+You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the\n+Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of\n+using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require\n+acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to\n+propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not\n+accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you\n+indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n+\n+### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients\n+\n+Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license\n+from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this\n+License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this\n+License.\n+\n+An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an\n+organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or\n+merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity\n+transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also\n+receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or\n+could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n+Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor\n+has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n+\n+You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or\n+affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty,\n+or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not\n+initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging\n+that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or\n+importing the Program or any portion of it.\n+\n+### 11. Patents\n+\n+A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n+License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus\n+licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.\n+\n+A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or\n+controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that\n+would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or\n+selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed\n+only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\n+purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent\n+sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n+\n+Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license\n+under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,\n+import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor\n+version.\n+\n+In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express\n+agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an\n+express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent\n+infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make\n+such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n+\n+If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the\n+Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge\n+and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or\n+other readily accessible means, then you must either **(1)** cause the Corresponding\n+Source to be so available, or **(2)** arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n+patent license for this particular work, or **(3)** arrange, in a manner consistent with\n+the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream\n+recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but\n+for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your\n+recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more\n+identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n+\n+If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you\n+convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent\n+license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,\n+propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent\n+license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and\n+works based on it.\n+\n+A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the\n+scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the\n+non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this\n+License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with\n+a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make\n+payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the\n+work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive\n+the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license **(a)** in connection with\n+copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or **(b)**\n+primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain\n+the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license\n+was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n+\n+Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied\n+license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you\n+under applicable patent law.\n+\n+### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom\n+\n+If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\n+that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\n+conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy\n+simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n+obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you\n+agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from\n+those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms\n+and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n+\n+### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License\n+\n+Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or\n+combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero\n+General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.\n+The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered\n+work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section\n+13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n+\n+### 14. Revised Versions of this License\n+\n+The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU\n+General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit\n+to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that\n+a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later\n+version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\n+conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the\n+Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU\n+General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\n+Software Foundation.\n+\n+If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU\n+General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a\n+version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n+\n+Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no\n+additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of\n+your choosing to follow a later version.\n+\n+### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty\n+\n+THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\n+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\n+EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\n+QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\n+DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n+\n+### 16. Limitation of Liability\n+\n+IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY\n+COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS\n+PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\n+INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n+PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\n+OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\n+WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\n+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16\n+\n+If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be\n+given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local\n+law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in\n+connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies\n+a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n+\n+_END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS_\n+\n+## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs",

By contrast, the GNU General Public\n+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a\n+program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free\n+Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it\n+applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to\n+your programs, too.\n+\n+When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General\n+Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\n+copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source\n+code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\n+it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n+\n+To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or\n+asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if\n+you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to\n+respect the freedom of others.\n+\n+For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,\n+you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make\n+sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these\n+terms so they know their rights.\n+\n+Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: **(1)** assert\n+copyright on the software, and **(2)** offer you this License giving you legal permission\n+to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n+\n+For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is\n+no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL\n+requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not\n+be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n+\n+Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of\n+the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally\n+incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The\n+systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n+use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed\n+this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems\n+arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to\n+those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of\n+users.\n+\n+Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should\n+not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose\n+computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents\n+applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the\n+GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n+\n+The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n+\n+## TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+### 0. Definitions\n+\n+“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n+\n+“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n+works, such as semiconductor masks.\n+\n+“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n+License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and\n+“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\n+\n+To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in\n+a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The\n+resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a\n+work “based on” the earlier work.\n+\n+A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on\n+the Program.\n+\n+To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without\n+permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under\n+applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private\n+copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),\n+making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n+\n+To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n+parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer\n+network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n+\n+An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the\n+extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that **(1)**\n+displays an appropriate copyright notice, and **(2)** tells the user that there is no\n+warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that\n+licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this\n+License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n+menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n+\n+### 1. Source Code\n+\n+The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n+making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a\n+work.\n+\n+A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official\n+standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces\n+specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among\n+developers working in that language.\n+\n+The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than\n+the work as a whole, that **(a)** is included in the normal form of packaging a Major\n+Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and **(b)** serves only to\n+enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard\n+Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.\n+A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component\n+(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which\n+the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code\n+interpreter used to run it.\n+\n+The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the\n+source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object\n+code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However,\n+it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or\n+generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those\n+activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\n+includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and\n+the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work\n+is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or\n+control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n+\n+The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate\n+automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n+\n+The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n+\n+### 2. Basic Permissions\n+\n+All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the\n+Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License\n+explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The\n+output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,\n+given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights\n+of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n+\n+You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without\n+conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered\n+works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively\n+for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you\n+comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\n+control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so\n+exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit\n+them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship\n+with you.\n+\n+Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions\n+stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n+\n+### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law\n+\n+No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any\n+applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty\n+adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention\n+of such measures.\n+\n+When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of\n+technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising\n+rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any\n+intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,\n+against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention\n+of technological measures.\n+\n+### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies\n+\n+You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any\n+medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n+appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and\n+any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep\n+intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of\n+this License along with the Program.\n+\n+You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer\n+support or warranty protection for a fee.\n+\n+### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions\n+\n+You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from\n+the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that\n+you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+* **a)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a\n+relevant date.\n+* **b)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this\n+License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the\n+requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\n+* **c)** You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who\n+comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any\n+applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n+regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the\n+work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have\n+separately received it.\n+* **d)** If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal\n+Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display\n+Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n+\n+A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are\n+not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with\n+it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution\n+medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting\n+copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n+beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate\n+does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n+\n+### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms\n+\n+You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and\n+5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the\n+terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n+\n+* **a)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\n+physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a\n+durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n+* **b)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\n+physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least\n+three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for\n+that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either **(1)** a copy of\n+the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this\n+License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for\n+a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of\n+source, or **(2)** access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no\n+charge.\n+* **c)** Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to\n+provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and\n+noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in\n+accord with subsection 6b.\n+* **d)** Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for\n+a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way\n+through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy\n+the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object\n+code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server\n+(operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities,\n+provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find\n+the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,\n+you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy\n+these requirements.\n+* **e)** Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform\n+other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being\n+offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n+\n+A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the\n+Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the\n+object code work.\n+\n+A “User Product” is either **(1)** a “consumer product”, which\n+means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or\n+household purposes, or **(2)** anything designed or sold for incorporation into a\n+dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases\n+shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a\n+particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of\n+that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way\n+in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the\n+product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has\n+substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n+the only significant mode of use of the product.\n+\n+“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,\n+procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute\n+modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of\n+its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued\n+functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with\n+solely because modification has been made.\n+\n+If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for\n+use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which\n+the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient\n+in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is\n+characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be\n+accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if\n+neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code\n+on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n+\n+The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to\n+continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been\n+modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been\n+modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself\n+materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules\n+and protocols for communication across the network.\n+\n+Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with\n+this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an\n+implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no\n+special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n+\n+### 7. Additional Terms\n+\n+“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this\n+License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional\n+permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they\n+were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable\n+law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be\n+used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n+this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n+\n+When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any\n+additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional\n+permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you\n+modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a\n+covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n+\n+Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a\n+covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)\n+supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n+\n+* **a)** Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of\n+sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n+* **b)** Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author\n+attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works\n+containing it; or\n+* **c)** Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that\n+modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the\n+original version; or\n+* **d)** Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the\n+material; or\n+* **e)** Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,\n+trademarks, or service marks; or\n+* **f)** Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone\n+who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of\n+liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions\n+directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n+\n+All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further\n+restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received\n+it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License\n+along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a\n+license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying\n+under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of\n+that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such\n+relicensing or conveying.\n+\n+If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in\n+the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those\n+files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n+\n+Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a\n+separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply\n+either way.\n+\n+### 8. Termination\n+\n+You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under\n+this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will\n+automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses\n+granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n+\n+However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a\n+particular copyright holder is reinstated **(a)** provisionally, unless and until the\n+copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and **(b)** permanently,\n+if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n+prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n+\n+Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently\n+if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this\n+is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any\n+work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n+your receipt of the notice.\n+\n+Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of\n+parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your\n+rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to\n+receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n+\n+### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies\n+\n+You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the\n+Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of\n+using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require\n+acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to\n+propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not\n+accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you\n+indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n+\n+### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients\n+\n+Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license\n+from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this\n+License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this\n+License.\n+\n+An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an\n+organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or\n+merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity\n+transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also\n+receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or\n+could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n+Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor\n+has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n+\n+You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or\n+affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty,\n+or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not\n+initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging\n+that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or\n+importing the Program or any portion of it.\n+\n+### 11. Patents\n+\n+A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n+License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus\n+licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.\n+\n+A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or\n+controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that\n+would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or\n+selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed\n+only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\n+purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent\n+sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n+\n+Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license\n+under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,\n+import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor\n+version.\n+\n+In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express\n+agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an\n+express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent\n+infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make\n+such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n+\n+If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the\n+Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge\n+and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or\n+other readily accessible means, then you must either **(1)** cause the Corresponding\n+Source to be so available, or **(2)** arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n+patent license for this particular work, or **(3)** arrange, in a manner consistent with\n+the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream\n+recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but\n+for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your\n+recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more\n+identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n+\n+If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you\n+convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent\n+license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,\n+propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent\n+license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and\n+works based on it.\n+\n+A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the\n+scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the\n+non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this\n+License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with\n+a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make\n+payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the\n+work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive\n+the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license **(a)** in connection with\n+copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or **(b)**\n+primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain\n+the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license\n+was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n+\n+Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied\n+license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you\n+under applicable patent law.\n+\n+### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom\n+\n+If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\n+that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\n+conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy\n+simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n+obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you\n+agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from\n+those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms\n+and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n+\n+### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License\n+\n+Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or\n+combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero\n+General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.\n+The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered\n+work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section\n+13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n+\n+### 14. Revised Versions of this License\n+\n+The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU\n+General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit\n+to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that\n+a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later\n+version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\n+conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the\n+Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU\n+General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\n+Software Foundation.\n+\n+If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU\n+General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a\n+version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n+\n+Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no\n+additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of\n+your choosing to follow a later version.\n+\n+### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty\n+\n+THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\n+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\n+EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\n+QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\n+DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n+\n+### 16. Limitation of Liability\n+\n+IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY\n+COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS\n+PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\n+INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n+PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\n+OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\n+WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\n+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16\n+\n+If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be\n+given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local\n+law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in\n+connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies\n+a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n+\n+_END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS_\n+\n+## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs",

By contrast, the GNU General Public\n+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a\n+program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free\n+Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it\n+applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to\n+your programs, too.\n+\n+When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General\n+Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\n+copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source\n+code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\n+it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n+\n+To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or\n+asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if\n+you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to\n+respect the freedom of others.\n+\n+For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,\n+you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make\n+sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these\n+terms so they know their rights.\n+\n+Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: **(1)** assert\n+copyright on the software, and **(2)** offer you this License giving you legal permission\n+to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n+\n+For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is\n+no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL\n+requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not\n+be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n+\n+Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of\n+the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally\n+incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The\n+systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n+use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed\n+this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems\n+arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to\n+those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of\n+users.\n+\n+Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should\n+not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose\n+computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents\n+applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the\n+GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n+\n+The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n+\n+## TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+### 0. Definitions\n+\n+“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n+\n+“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n+works, such as semiconductor masks.\n+\n+“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n+License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and\n+“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\n+\n+To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in\n+a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The\n+resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a\n+work “based on” the earlier work.\n+\n+A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on\n+the Program.\n+\n+To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without\n+permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under\n+applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private\n+copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),\n+making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n+\n+To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n+parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer\n+network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n+\n+An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the\n+extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that **(1)**\n+displays an appropriate copyright notice, and **(2)** tells the user that there is no\n+warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that\n+licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this\n+License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n+menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n+\n+### 1. Source Code\n+\n+The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n+making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a\n+work.\n+\n+A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official\n+standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces\n+specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among\n+developers working in that language.\n+\n+The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than\n+the work as a whole, that **(a)** is included in the normal form of packaging a Major\n+Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and **(b)** serves only to\n+enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard\n+Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.\n+A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component\n+(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which\n+the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code\n+interpreter used to run it.\n+\n+The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the\n+source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object\n+code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However,\n+it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or\n+generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those\n+activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\n+includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and\n+the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work\n+is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or\n+control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n+\n+The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate\n+automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n+\n+The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n+\n+### 2. Basic Permissions\n+\n+All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the\n+Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License\n+explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The\n+output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,\n+given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights\n+of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n+\n+You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without\n+conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered\n+works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively\n+for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you\n+comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\n+control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so\n+exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit\n+them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship\n+with you.\n+\n+Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions\n+stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n+\n+### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law\n+\n+No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any\n+applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty\n+adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention\n+of such measures.\n+\n+When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of\n+technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising\n+rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any\n+intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,\n+against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention\n+of technological measures.\n+\n+### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies\n+\n+You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any\n+medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n+appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and\n+any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep\n+intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of\n+this License along with the Program.\n+\n+You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer\n+support or warranty protection for a fee.\n+\n+### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions\n+\n+You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from\n+the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that\n+you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+* **a)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a\n+relevant date.\n+* **b)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this\n+License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the\n+requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\n+* **c)** You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who\n+comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any\n+applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n+regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the\n+work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have\n+separately received it.\n+* **d)** If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal\n+Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display\n+Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n+\n+A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are\n+not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with\n+it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution\n+medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting\n+copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n+beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate\n+does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n+\n+### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms\n+\n+You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and\n+5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the\n+terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n+\n+* **a)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\n+physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a\n+durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n+* **b)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\n+physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least\n+three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for\n+that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either **(1)** a copy of\n+the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this\n+License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for\n+a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of\n+source, or **(2)** access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no\n+charge.\n+* **c)** Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to\n+provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and\n+noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in\n+accord with subsection 6b.\n+* **d)** Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for\n+a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way\n+through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy\n+the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object\n+code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server\n+(operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities,\n+provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find\n+the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,\n+you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy\n+these requirements.\n+* **e)** Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform\n+other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being\n+offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n+\n+A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the\n+Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the\n+object code work.\n+\n+A “User Product” is either **(1)** a “consumer product”, which\n+means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or\n+household purposes, or **(2)** anything designed or sold for incorporation into a\n+dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases\n+shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a\n+particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of\n+that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way\n+in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the\n+product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has\n+substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n+the only significant mode of use of the product.\n+\n+“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,\n+procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute\n+modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of\n+its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued\n+functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with\n+solely because modification has been made.\n+\n+If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for\n+use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which\n+the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient\n+in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is\n+characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be\n+accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if\n+neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code\n+on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n+\n+The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to\n+continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been\n+modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been\n+modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself\n+materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules\n+and protocols for communication across the network.\n+\n+Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with\n+this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an\n+implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no\n+special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n+\n+### 7. Additional Terms\n+\n+“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this\n+License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional\n+permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they\n+were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable\n+law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be\n+used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n+this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n+\n+When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any\n+additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional\n+permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you\n+modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a\n+covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n+\n+Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a\n+covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)\n+supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n+\n+* **a)** Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of\n+sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n+* **b)** Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author\n+attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works\n+containing it; or\n+* **c)** Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that\n+modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the\n+original version; or\n+* **d)** Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the\n+material; or\n+* **e)** Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,\n+trademarks, or service marks; or\n+* **f)** Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone\n+who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of\n+liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions\n+directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n+\n+All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further\n+restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received\n+it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License\n+along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a\n+license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying\n+under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of\n+that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such\n+relicensing or conveying.\n+\n+If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in\n+the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those\n+files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n+\n+Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a\n+separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply\n+either way.\n+\n+### 8. Termination\n+\n+You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under\n+this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will\n+automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses\n+granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n+\n+However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a\n+particular copyright holder is reinstated **(a)** provisionally, unless and until the\n+copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and **(b)** permanently,\n+if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n+prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n+\n+Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently\n+if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this\n+is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any\n+work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n+your receipt of the notice.\n+\n+Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of\n+parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your\n+rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to\n+receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n+\n+### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies\n+\n+You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the\n+Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of\n+using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require\n+acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to\n+propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not\n+accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you\n+indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n+\n+### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients\n+\n+Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license\n+from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this\n+License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this\n+License.\n+\n+An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an\n+organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or\n+merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity\n+transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also\n+receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or\n+could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n+Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor\n+has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n+\n+You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or\n+affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty,\n+or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not\n+initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging\n+that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or\n+importing the Program or any portion of it.\n+\n+### 11. Patents\n+\n+A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n+License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus\n+licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.\n+\n+A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or\n+controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that\n+would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or\n+selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed\n+only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\n+purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent\n+sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n+\n+Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license\n+under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,\n+import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor\n+version.\n+\n+In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express\n+agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an\n+express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent\n+infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make\n+such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n+\n+If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the\n+Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge\n+and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or\n+other readily accessible means, then you must either **(1)** cause the Corresponding\n+Source to be so available, or **(2)** arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n+patent license for this particular work, or **(3)** arrange, in a manner consistent with\n+the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream\n+recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but\n+for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your\n+recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more\n+identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n+\n+If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you\n+convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent\n+license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,\n+propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent\n+license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and\n+works based on it.\n+\n+A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the\n+scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the\n+non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this\n+License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with\n+a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make\n+payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the\n+work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive\n+the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license **(a)** in connection with\n+copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or **(b)**\n+primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain\n+the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license\n+was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n+\n+Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied\n+license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you\n+under applicable patent law.\n+\n+### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom\n+\n+If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\n+that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\n+conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy\n+simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n+obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you\n+agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from\n+those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms\n+and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n+\n+### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License\n+\n+Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or\n+combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero\n+General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.\n+The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered\n+work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section\n+13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n+\n+### 14. Revised Versions of this License\n+\n+The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU\n+General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit\n+to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that\n+a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later\n+version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\n+conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the\n+Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU\n+General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\n+Software Foundation.\n+\n+If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU\n+General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a\n+version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n+\n+Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no\n+additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of\n+your choosing to follow a later version.\n+\n+### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty\n+\n+THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\n+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\n+EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\n+QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\n+DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n+\n+### 16. Limitation of Liability\n+\n+IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY\n+COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS\n+PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\n+INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n+PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\n+OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\n+WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\n+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16\n+\n+If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be\n+given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local\n+law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in\n+connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies\n+a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n+\n+_END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS_\n+\n+## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs",

By contrast, the GNU General Public\n+License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a\n+program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free\n+Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it\n+applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to\n+your programs, too.\n+\n+When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General\n+Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\n+copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source\n+code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of\n+it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n+\n+To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or\n+asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if\n+you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to\n+respect the freedom of others.\n+\n+For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,\n+you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make\n+sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these\n+terms so they know their rights.\n+\n+Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: **(1)** assert\n+copyright on the software, and **(2)** offer you this License giving you legal permission\n+to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n+\n+For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is\n+no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL\n+requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not\n+be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\n+\n+Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of\n+the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally\n+incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The\n+systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n+use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed\n+this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems\n+arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to\n+those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of\n+users.\n+\n+Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should\n+not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose\n+computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents\n+applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the\n+GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n+\n+The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n+\n+## TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n+\n+### 0. Definitions\n+\n+“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n+\n+“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n+works, such as semiconductor masks.\n+\n+“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n+License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and\n+“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\n+\n+To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in\n+a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The\n+resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a\n+work “based on” the earlier work.\n+\n+A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on\n+the Program.\n+\n+To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without\n+permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under\n+applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private\n+copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),\n+making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n+\n+To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n+parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer\n+network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n+\n+An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the\n+extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that **(1)**\n+displays an appropriate copyright notice, and **(2)** tells the user that there is no\n+warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that\n+licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this\n+License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n+menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n+\n+### 1. Source Code\n+\n+The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n+making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a\n+work.\n+\n+A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official\n+standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces\n+specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among\n+developers working in that language.\n+\n+The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than\n+the work as a whole, that **(a)** is included in the normal form of packaging a Major\n+Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and **(b)** serves only to\n+enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard\n+Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.\n+A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component\n+(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which\n+the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code\n+interpreter used to run it.\n+\n+The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the\n+source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object\n+code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However,\n+it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or\n+generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those\n+activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\n+includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and\n+the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work\n+is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or\n+control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\n+\n+The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate\n+automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n+\n+The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n+\n+### 2. Basic Permissions\n+\n+All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the\n+Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License\n+explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The\n+output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,\n+given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights\n+of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n+\n+You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without\n+conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered\n+works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively\n+for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you\n+comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\n+control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so\n+exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit\n+them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship\n+with you.\n+\n+Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions\n+stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n+\n+### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law\n+\n+No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any\n+applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty\n+adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention\n+of such measures.\n+\n+When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of\n+technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising\n+rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any\n+intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,\n+against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention\n+of technological measures.\n+\n+### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies\n+\n+You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any\n+medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n+appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and\n+any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep\n+intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of\n+this License along with the Program.\n+\n+You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer\n+support or warranty protection for a fee.\n+\n+### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions\n+\n+You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from\n+the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that\n+you also meet all of these conditions:\n+\n+* **a)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a\n+relevant date.\n+* **b)** The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this\n+License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the\n+requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\n+* **c)** You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who\n+comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any\n+applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n+regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the\n+work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have\n+separately received it.\n+* **d)** If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal\n+Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display\n+Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n+\n+A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are\n+not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with\n+it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution\n+medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting\n+copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n+beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate\n+does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n+\n+### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms\n+\n+You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and\n+5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the\n+terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n+\n+* **a)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\n+physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a\n+durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\n+* **b)** Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a\n+physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least\n+three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for\n+that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either **(1)** a copy of\n+the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this\n+License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for\n+a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of\n+source, or **(2)** access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no\n+charge.\n+* **c)** Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to\n+provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and\n+noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in\n+accord with subsection 6b.\n+* **d)** Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for\n+a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way\n+through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy\n+the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object\n+code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server\n+(operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities,\n+provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find\n+the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,\n+you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy\n+these requirements.\n+* **e)** Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform\n+other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being\n+offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n+\n+A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the\n+Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the\n+object code work.\n+\n+A “User Product” is either **(1)** a “consumer product”, which\n+means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or\n+household purposes, or **(2)** anything designed or sold for incorporation into a\n+dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases\n+shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a\n+particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of\n+that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way\n+in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the\n+product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has\n+substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n+the only significant mode of use of the product.\n+\n+“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,\n+procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute\n+modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of\n+its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued\n+functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with\n+solely because modification has been made.\n+\n+If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for\n+use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which\n+the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient\n+in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is\n+characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be\n+accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if\n+neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code\n+on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\n+\n+The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to\n+continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been\n+modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been\n+modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself\n+materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules\n+and protocols for communication across the network.\n+\n+Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with\n+this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an\n+implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no\n+special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n+\n+### 7. Additional Terms\n+\n+“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this\n+License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional\n+permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they\n+were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable\n+law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be\n+used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n+this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n+\n+When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any\n+additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional\n+permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you\n+modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a\n+covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n+\n+Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a\n+covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)\n+supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n+\n+* **a)** Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of\n+sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n+* **b)** Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author\n+attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works\n+containing it; or\n+* **c)** Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that\n+modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the\n+original version; or\n+* **d)** Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the\n+material; or\n+* **e)** Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,\n+trademarks, or service marks; or\n+* **f)** Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone\n+who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of\n+liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions\n+directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n+\n+All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further\n+restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received\n+it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License\n+along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a\n+license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying\n+under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of\n+that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such\n+relicensing or conveying.\n+\n+If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in\n+the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those\n+files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\n+\n+Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a\n+separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply\n+either way.\n+\n+### 8. Termination\n+\n+You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under\n+this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will\n+automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses\n+granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\n+\n+However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a\n+particular copyright holder is reinstated **(a)** provisionally, unless and until the\n+copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and **(b)** permanently,\n+if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n+prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n+\n+Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently\n+if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this\n+is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any\n+work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n+your receipt of the notice.\n+\n+Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of\n+parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your\n+rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to\n+receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n+\n+### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies\n+\n+You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the\n+Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of\n+using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require\n+acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to\n+propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not\n+accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you\n+indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n+\n+### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients\n+\n+Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license\n+from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this\n+License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this\n+License.\n+\n+An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an\n+organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or\n+merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity\n+transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also\n+receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or\n+could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n+Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor\n+has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n+\n+You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or\n+affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty,\n+or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not\n+initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging\n+that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or\n+importing the Program or any portion of it.\n+\n+### 11. Patents\n+\n+A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n+License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus\n+licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.\n+\n+A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or\n+controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that\n+would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or\n+selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed\n+only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\n+purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent\n+sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\n+\n+Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license\n+under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,\n+import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor\n+version.\n+\n+In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express\n+agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an\n+express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent\n+infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make\n+such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\n+\n+If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the\n+Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge\n+and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or\n+other readily accessible means, then you must either **(1)** cause the Corresponding\n+Source to be so available, or **(2)** arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n+patent license for this particular work, or **(3)** arrange, in a manner consistent with\n+the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream\n+recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but\n+for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your\n+recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more\n+identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n+\n+If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you\n+convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent\n+license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,\n+propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent\n+license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and\n+works based on it.\n+\n+A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the\n+scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the\n+non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this\n+License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with\n+a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make\n+payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the\n+work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive\n+the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license **(a)** in connection with\n+copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or **(b)**\n+primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain\n+the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license\n+was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n+\n+Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied\n+license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you\n+under applicable patent law.\n+\n+### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom\n+\n+If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)\n+that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\n+conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy\n+simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\n+obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you\n+agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from\n+those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms\n+and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n+\n+### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License\n+\n+Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or\n+combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero\n+General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.\n+The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered\n+work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section\n+13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n+\n+### 14. Revised Versions of this License\n+\n+The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU\n+General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit\n+to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n+\n+Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that\n+a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later\n+version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\n+conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the\n+Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU\n+General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\n+Software Foundation.\n+\n+If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU\n+General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a\n+version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\n+\n+Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no\n+additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of\n+your choosing to follow a later version.\n+\n+### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty\n+\n+THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\n+PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\n+EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n+MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\n+QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\n+DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n+\n+### 16. Limitation of Liability\n+\n+IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY\n+COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS\n+PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,\n+INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n+PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE\n+OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\n+WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\n+POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n+\n+### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16\n+\n+If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be\n+given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local\n+law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in\n+connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies\n+a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n+\n+_END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS_\n+\n+## How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs",
