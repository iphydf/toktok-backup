I would say multi devices should mean one tox id mapped to several dht pk, while each device will use a different dht pk, and they share the same tox id.\r\n\r\nFurthermore this pull request effectively, compared the original code, makes NO change at all. Let's name version 0 for the version without this modification, version1 for the version with this modification.  Then version1 is completely compatible with version0. And version 1 will also be compatible with version 2(even for setup case, pkPacket is not required to be pkTarget, The key to support multiple devices is to change pkTarget to pkTarget + deviceID. For single device, it is the map between pkTarget & pkDHT, for multiple device, it is the map between pkTarget+device and pkDHT+deviceID). \r\n\r\nWith this \"basic\" modification, even 0x85/0x86, 0x18,0x19,0x1A are not modified, it can allow other implementation to utilize the network to support other type of IDs(the version 2) as it allow the detach of pkPacket and pkTarget. \r\n\r\nGive this basic modification effectively makes no change, I really hope you can accept it. Further modification, for whatever reason, if you do not want to accept it, I would not beg for it.\r\n",

This modification does not make any choice between two options since this modification effectively makes no change. It does not affect option#1 at all, but it would allow option#2 becomes possible.\r\n\r\nIt would also allow other type of toxid(pkTarget) becomes possible since it does not require pkPacket of 0x83 message to be pkTarget(the pk specified by a toxid).\r\n\r\nClearly option#1 is a high level option, while option#2 is a low level option. option#1 might be much easier to implement on the top of the original toxcore, while option#2 is much easier for reimplementation based on tox protocol.\r\n\r\nFor option#2, if you reimplement the tox protocol, then all your questions are resolved. But how to modify c-toxcore for option#2. It is a little bit complicated, I would like to put the details off. Here, just briefly address your questions:\r\n\r\nQ: Are you sure using same tox id with different dht pk will work?\r\nA: yes, very sure. \r\n\r\nQ: How friends will connect to the same tox id with different dht pks?\r\nA: between different friends, equivalently, between different Friend_Conn.\r\nEach device with one Net_Crypto(dht pk) structure, they all share the same friend_connect(toxid) and onion_friend(toxid). For Friend_Conn & Onion_Friend, dht related stuff needs encapsulation, to allow 1 to many. \r\n\r\nQ: How devices will communicate with each other? \r\nThis modification gets 0x83 & 0x84 ready, for reimplementation, the whole network support option#2.\r\nwhile For toxcore, need more phases: DHT announce through 0x85 & 0x86(should be modified to allow deviceID), once received DHT pk for a device, auto connection as usual(0x18 should be modified a bit to indicate the deviceID). so devices are connected. Then I prefer to extend the protocol to allow synchronization between devices.\r\n\r\nOne more time, this modification makes no change effectively. You can review the code and you will see effectively makes no change at all. But this modification would allow option#2 prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For communication, different devices use different key pairs, they never use the same key pair for communication. But since they all attached to the same toxid! The purpose of the proposal is to map different dht key pairs to the same toxid. Yes, there is one same private key for the toxid! One same secret for user authentication.\r\nIf the device compromised, then yes, it affects all devices since all devices are equal.\r\n\r\nUnless you define master & slave devices, you have the same situation no matter what kind of approach. The same user have to be authenticated on multiple devices. How to identify/authenticate the user? My proposal is to use the same toxid, so same private key pair. Though it is rarely used, it is used only to authenticated the user locally and remotely. Communications(Net_Crypto) are using session key pair, though its setup is based on dht key pair, and involves toxid key pair as for remote friend authentication.\r\n\r\n",

By the way, the modification of this PR by now, has nothing to do with all these.\r\n\r\nThe modification of this PR is to handle 0x83 message \"correctly\".\r\n0x83 + nonce24 + pkPacket32 + encrypted120\r\n\twhile encrypted120 = pingid32 + pkTarget32 + pkData32 + reqID8 + mac16\r\n\r\npkPacket32 and nonce24 are used to decrypt. pkTarget is the pk in toxID.\r\n\r\nThis message is used for 2 cases: setup and query.\r\nquery: pingid32=0, pkData32=0, pkPacket32 is random, pkTarget32 is toxid.\r\nsetup:  pkData32 !=0, pingid32 might be 0, pkPacket32 == pkTarget32.\r\n\r\nThis modification is to use pkTarget32 always, and not to use pkPacket32 even they are same.\r\nFor the setup case, pkPacket32 == pkTarget32 is unnecessary leaking toxPK.\r\n\r\nany expert is welcome! I really hope some experts can look at this to see whether this PR can do any harm. This PR by now is not tied to my proposal to multidevices support at all.\r\n\r\n",

If I am not wrong(for this issue, very unlikely to be wrong), you misunderstood it.  You can run the code, and test it, you are going to see. \r\n\r\nYour \"self announce\" is what I called \"setup\", and your \"annouces to friends\" is what I called \"query\". In fact, your view is wrong(not right) since DHT announce is done with 0x9C wrapped into 0x85 & 0x86 message, not with 0x83 & 0x84 message.\r\n\r\n3 parties involved here: a user identified by toxID(pkTarget), a friend of this user, a middle man.\r\nBoth the user and the friend sends 0x83, and will receive 0x84 as response. 0x83 is sent to the middle man, the middle man responds with 0x84. The middle man is 0x83 & 0x85 receiver, and 0x84 & 0x86 sender.\r\n\r\nEither 0x83 message is used by the user(toxID,pkTarget) to \"setup\" a forward mechanism with a middle man. The user has to send 0x83 twice, first time with pindid=0, 2nd with right pingid. pingid is generated by the middle man. The forward mechanism is intended to forward message to the user(pkTarget). Hence, I call it \"setup\".\r\n\r\nOr 083 message is used by the friend to query whether a forward mechanism to the user(pkTarget) exists. Hence, I call it \"query\". If the forward mechanism exists, then use 0x9C wrapped into 0x85 to announce the friend's DHT pk, and the middle man will turn 0x85 into 0x86 and \"forward\" 0x86 to the user(pkTarget). \r\n\r\nDid I make this clear?\r\n\r\nIn more detail, the dht announcement is with 0x9C wrapped into 0x85, then 0x85 will be wrapped into 0x80(0x81(0x82(0x85))) and delivered to the middle man, once the middle man got 0x85, it turns 0x85 into 0x86, and forward 0x86 to pkTarget.  Onion means 0x80(0x81(0x82(0x85(0x9C)))) and 0x8C(0x8D(0x8E)))+0x86.\r\n\r\nBy the way, 0x83 is also wrapped into 0x80(0x81(0x82(0x83))) and delivered to the middle man, and 0x84 is attached to 0x8C(0x8D(0x8E))).\r\n",

We do this by requiring that the payload of the announce request is encrypted with the public key which is requested to be announced. This is explained in the spec. This PR would remove that crucial check, allowing anyone to announce any public key.\r\n\r\nThe \"leak\" you mention is I assume referring to the third node in the onion chain being able to see the public key being announced. But the third node in any case inevitably knows the DHT public key of the node the announce request is sent to, and this will be close (in XOR distance) to the public key being announced. So this doesn't leak much more information than is necessary. The intention of the onion is to have the third node unable to determine the DHT key of the sender of the packet along the onion route.",

            "body": "@zugz glad to see your message.\r\n\r\nYes, call it \"announce request\" is OK, since it is not about announce, but to setup a forward mechanism to forward \"dht announce\" from friends to the 0x83 sender(identified by the toxid pk, pkTarget). \r\n\r\nAbout the \"leaking\", Yes. it is between the 3rd node and the middle man(the 0x83 receiver, 0x84 sender, the \"4th node\" of the onion) when doing setup the \"announce request\"(the forward mechanism). And you are right, 0x83 message is to be sent by any user (with toxID pk) to the middle man whose dht pk is \"close\" to the toxID pk, but the 3rd node knows only that the toxID pk is \"close\" to the 4th node's dht pk which the 3rd node clearly knows. When we allow leaking, the 3rd might participate in blocking the toxID pk. If we prevent this leaking, only the middle man is able to block the toxID pk.\r\n\r\nYou saying that the middle man can require the target of the forward mechanism(0x83 sender) is indeed the owner of the toxID pk(in possession of its private key). Yes, if the middle man do not do this check up, then any adversary can claim to be the user with the toxID pk, and with this mechanism, the friends of this toxID would send their dht announce to the adversary. Though the adversary is not able to know their dht pk(in 0x9C) since it is encrypted in 0x85, but the adversary can see the toxID pk of the friends in 0x85. Hence, for the 0x83 receiver, this authentication of the sender of the 0x83 is indeed meaningful.\r\n\r\nHonestly speaking, my current goal is to decouple the decryption and the authentication. When authentication is not possible, I just want to abandon it. I want to use other type of PK as toxID pk rather than ec25519. But the dht pk of the middle man is of ec25519. It is impossible for them to have the shared key to do decryption. Given the authentication is indeed needed, a simple modification can not achieve my goal. I would instead try to propose using a new message id such as 0x87.\r\n\r\n0x87 will be similar to 0x83, but with some extension.\r\n\r\n0x83 + nonce24 + pkPacket32 + encrypted120\r\n\twhile encrypted120 = pingid32 + pkTarget32 + pkData32 + reqID8 + mac16\r\n\r\n0x87 + epkPacket + nonce + encrypted\r\n\twhile encrypted = epkTarget + sig + reqID8 + timestamp8  + mac\r\n        or  encrypted = epkTarget + sig + reqID8 + timestamp8 + pingid32(!=0) + pkData32 + mac\r\nThe encrypted is decrypted with epkPacket & the dht pk of the 0x87 receiver.\r\nThe signature is on the sha256 of reqID8 + timestamp8 + nonce when pingid32=0, or on the sha256 of reqID8 + timestamp8 + pingid32 + pkData32 when pingid32!=0. \r\n\r\nepkPacket & epkTarget are extended PK, are starting with a variant size integer to indicate the PK type which is followed by PK. Both nonce size and signature structure are defined by the PK type. In this way, the decryption of the message is decoupled from authentication.\r\n\r\nEC25519 PK is assigned with type 1, and sec256k1 PK is assigned with type 0, etc. \r\n\r\nany comment?\r\n",
