Whether your team is comparing changes in a pull request or reviewing a single commit, Codecov will improve the code review workflow and quality.\r\n\r\n## Code coverage done right.®\r\n\r\n1. Upload coverage reports from your CI builds.\r\n2. Codecov merges all builds and languages into one beautiful coherent report.\r\n3. Get commit statuses, pull request comments and coverage overlay via our browser extension.\r\n\r\nWhen Codecov merges your uploads it keeps track of the CI provider (inc. build details) and user specified context, e.g. `#unittest` ~ `#smoketest` or `#oldcode` ~ `#newcode`. You can track the `#unittest` coverage independently of other groups.

Why exactly do we want to avoid calling `make install` on toxcore to build clients? Is it that troublesome to have toxcore installed before building a client?\r\n\r\nYes, it's quite troublesome when developing toxcore together with a client. Iterating on both client and toxcore development is slowed down quite a bit by having to make install each time. I don't suffer from this myself, because I develop mostly using bazel.\r\n\r\n>    1. Even simple clients like echobot would still require that libsodium is installed, no? (or can libsodium be included as source too?)\r\n\r\nlibsodium isn't co-developed with clients, so the above is less of an issue. libsodium also generally changes less, so installing it once is less overhead than installing toxcore many times as it's in active development.\r\n\r\n> 2. Do we really want to commit to supporting clients building directly off the toxcore source code in addition to the installed prefix (binaries + include files)?\r\n\r\nYes. Until it's too much of a burden.\r\n\r\n>    1. Doesn't that restrict us from adding some logic to our build system that modifies the code at build time, for example template substitution?\r\n\r\nYes, and that's quite intentional. We should stay away from build system integrated codegen as much as possible. Generating files and committing them to git is ok, we already do that for events, and we may do more of that as part of semfmt, but we should always in principle own all our code.\r\n\r\n> 3. Isn't it better to change the repository's file structure around instead of changing the `/usr/local/include` structure, which will affect (break) all downstream projects?\r\n\r\nWhy is it better? This PR does not break any downstream projects.\r\n\r\n>    1. I see that in this PR you have created `tox/{tox.h, toxav.h, toxencryptsave.h}` in the repository, which contain just the `#include {toxcore/tox.h, toxav/toxav.h, toxencryptsave/toxencryptsave.h}` line -- isn't that already enough for what you are trying to achieve, without having to change the `/usr/local/include` structure?\r\n\r\nIt's not quite enough, because one other things that this change enables is that toxav could include \"../toxcore/tox.h\" instead of re-declaring `struct Tox` with the ifndef thing around it (which is trouble for many reasons, not the least C++ modules and apigen).\r\n\r\n>    2. Some projects, e.g. VLC, have `include/` in their repository for files that define the public API. This is just one of the possible ways to re-arrange the files within the repository, but what do you think about it?\r\n\r\nThat's possible, but right now you can simply do `tcc my_code.c $(find tox* -name \"*.c\") third_party/cmp/cmp.c)` and have a working binary. That's really quite nice, and something that @irungentoo has always been doing and has made quite sure to always continue supporting (this is also why we committed apidsl outputs instead of build-system-ing them).\r\n\r\n> Feels a bit weird that a single `libtoxcore` library / the c-toxcore project, uses three separate `/usr/local/include/{toxcore,toxav,toxencryptsave}` namespaces, instead of using just one and subdirectoring it.\r\n\r\nThe 3 libraries are really quite separate libraries and should become even more separate. We're building a single .so for convenience (used to build multiple), but I can see a future in which toxav is maintained in a separate repo, build, install, etc (not necessarily in practice, but we should make it theoretically possible, so design decisions should move us towards that being possible).\r\n\r\n> This doesn't seem to be a common thing to do. Are there some precedents of other projects doing this?\r\n\r\nProbably. I can't think of any right now, but I'm also not very interested in following precedents, and rather make logical decisions based on goals and requirements.",
