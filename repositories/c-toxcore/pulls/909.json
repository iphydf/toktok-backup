I thought you were talking about `tox_new()`, which would make no sense.\r\n\r\nTaking a second look at this PR (it was years since the last time I looked into it), why are you allocating a string in `tox_options_set_proxy_host()` and setting it onto `Tox_Options`? You are not allowed to do that. It should set user-provided host string on `Tox_Options`, such that `tox_options_get_proxy_host()` would return the same user-provided string back. The correct time to copy the user-provided host string into the internal state is inside the `tox_new()` call. `tox_options_*()` functions shouldn't be allocating or freeing any memory, they are just dumb setters/getters for `Tox_Options` struct. All the input validation logic (see `TOX_ERR_NEW` error struct), allocation/deallocating and everything else happens in `tox_new()`, into which that `Tox_Options` is passed.",

I have totally forgotten about #908.\r\n\r\nLike I have said in that issue, we could change the semantics of `tox_options_set_*` functions so that they do a deep copy instead, but only after we make `Tox_Options` struct opaque, as this is incompatible with the user being able to set the struct fields directly. So this PR can't be merged until that's done (presumably in a separate PR).\r\n\r\nAlso, when `Tox_Options` does become opaque, even though we could do such a change, it warrants a discussion if we really should do such a change, as it's rather breaking. Firstly, it's API-breaking, even for users that have used only the `tox_options_*` functions and avoiding setting the struct fields directly, as the function signatures would need to change. Because the `tox_options_set_*` functions taking buffers now allocate inside, they would require an extra argument for the error enum to indicate the allocation failure. Secondly, it's behavior-breaking -- users might have relied on `tox_options_get`'ing their pointers back and freeing them, and such memory ownership change might catch them off-guard when updating toxcore.\r\n\r\nI'm not opposed to the change, just want to see if we think that pros outweight the cons. Breaking the API and possibly unintentionally introducing memory corruption bugs into clients by changing the memory ownership model under them shouldn't be done without a good reason. I have yet to see a good reason for making this change though. (Surprisingly, there wasn't any reason provided before your last comment, unless it was discussed on the IRC at the time).\r\n\r\n>The problem I see with not deep-copying the data into Tox_Options is that the user has to track the lifetime of multiple objects (savedata_data, proxy_host) instead of just the Tox_Options struct, which easily leads to mistakes.\r\n\r\nCan you give an example of such a mistake? I'm having hard time understanding as `savedata_data` and `proxy_host` should have the same lifetime as `Tox_Options` itself -- user has to track the lifetimes until passing `Tox_Options` into `tox_new()`, at which point toxcore would make a copy of the data and the user is free to do whatever they want with `savedata_data`, `proxy_host` and `Tox_Options` itself: free them, or keep them around to be used for creating another tox instance or whatever. User also doesn't have to keep track of all the `savedata_data`, `proxy_host`, etc. variables individually, they can keep track just of the `Tox_Options` struct and get all their pointers back by using the `tox_options_get_*()` family of functions. So I'd argue that it's not that hard to track their lifetimes (and as a bonus you don't even have to keep track of their pointers), all you need to keep track of is `Tox_Options`'s lifetime, as they are the same. (Also, in practice, the lifetime of `Tox_Options` is so short, that you often end up creating it, setting things on it and deallocating it all within a single function, so it feels like this change in lifetimes would break things for very little gain.)",

Setters doing a deep copy breaks the common expectation that getters return the same object that was passed into the setters.`set(foo); assert(get() == foo);`. This is not intuitive and is bound to cause users write buggy code.\r\n2. Getters return the same object that was passed into the setter. Returning a different object is a big behavioral break, which is a kind of API break. Users might have relied on getting their objects back e.g. to free them. They might update to the new toxcore with the deep copying change, fix any API issues that prevent the code from compiling, but not realize that the behavior of setters/getters has changed and now they would have bugs in their programs.\r\n3. Some of the error handling will have to be moved out of `tox_new()` into the setters. The buffer setters would need to have an extra error enum argument added to indicate the allocation failure. Adding an extra argument to setters would break API. It might also make users restructure their code, since before they had to handle errors only around `tox_new()` alone, but now they need to handle the setters erroring too.\r\n\r\nSo in short, there are too many drawbacks to this change:\r\n  - This change doesn't benefit toxcore in any way. Moving deep copying from `tox_new()` to setters is of no benefit to toxcore.\r\n  - This change doesn't benefit existing toxcore users. It breaks things for the existing users of setters and getters -- (3) and might introduce bugs into users' programs -- (2).\r\n  - This change might confuse new users as setters deep copying and getters returning a different object is rather unintuitive -- (1).\r\n\r\nIn comparison, leaving things as they are -- toxcore deep copying inside `tox_new()` -- has zero drawbacks.",
