Then, when I come home, I want\r\nto continue talking from my PC. It would be awesome to pass the call to my\r\nother device seamlessly, without having to re-dial that person I’m talking to.\r\n>\r\n>Guess, that wouldn’t be too hard to implement as long as all devices know\r\nabout all other devices: you just give user a list, and then he decides what\r\ndevice to pass the call to.\r\n\r\nAlso, I thought a little bit further and realized, that this function shouldn't really stop at devices belonging to one person. There also should be possibility to redirect a call to another person entirely. The mechanism is basically the same, it only should differ visually.\r\nSay, I get a call from a customer. I run into issue or a question, that I can't solve and answer, but my friend on the other desk can. Telling him to come over here is lame. Giving the customer his Tox ID and hoping that they call back is also lame. I just throw this call to my friend via menu.\r\n\r\nSo basically, it works like PBX without actually having a PBX.\r\n\r\nMay be this is a bit too much, but that's just a proposal, make of it what you will.\r\n",

I just throw this call to my friend via menu.\n\nThe thing is that your friend must be in customer's friend list before the friend and the customer can communicate. They need a direct `ip:port <-> ip:port` connection between their computers, and you get ip:port of a person by friending them.\n\nYou can route friend's and the customer's call through your tox client in the middle, but then it would be possible for you to eavesdrop on their conversation, since the friend would encrypt the audio/video packets for you, and you would decrypt them and encrypt for the customer, and same the other way -- customer would encrypt their audio/video packets for you, and you would decrypt them and re-encrypt for the friend. This will consume your cpu, ram and bandwidth. This also would add latency to the audio/video call, since you are in the middle now. This is something you can do right now, there is no need to change something in toxcore, it just requires client support.\n\nYou could do something similar to the last paragraph -- route friend's and customer's traffic through you, but ask the friend to encrypt it for the customer instead of encrypting it for you and ask the customer for encrypting it for the friend instead of you. Essentially, you would need to give to the friend customer's public key and to the customer friend's public key (public key is Tox Id). In this case you won't be able to eavesdrop on the conversation, but your cpu/ram/bandwidth would still be used for routing and there would be some latency in the call introduced by you.\n",
