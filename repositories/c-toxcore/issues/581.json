            "body": "> @JFreegman From what I'm reading, public groups rely on having a Founder who generates a keypair, in which the public key of said keypair is the chat id. In my suggestion, the \"chat id\" is not a public key, but rather the hash of an arbitrary string. Aside from not requiring (or allowing) a \"founder\" who knows the private key matching the public key, it's also a lot easier to share an arbitrary string than a public key, because an arbitrary string can be human-readable, and a public key is not.\r\n\r\nIt would be fairly simple to abstract the Chat ID out using things like public group directories or QR codes. But since all group validation requires certain cryptographic guarantees on the basis of it using a fully decentralized architecture, there's no getting around using keys. \r\n\r\nThe main issue with using a hash of a string is that multiple people could use the same string, which produces the same hash, and when you join a group there would be no way to verify that you're in the \"right\" one. If you were to do a uniqueness check on creation, then it would be possible to steal/subvert groups that are currently offline. To solve that problem you would need to use some sort of distributed storage solution. With keys as identifiers none of this is an issue because it's effectively impossible for two peers to create a group with the same Chat ID.",

The implication is that same string = same group. The idea is that if two people \"accidentally\" use the same string, then they end up in the same group, even if they made no coordination attempt prior. You prevent it from being the \"wrong\" group by using a sufficient descriptive string, so that no one would enter the group without having the same idea. For instance, if you create a group from the string \"Talks about Mortal Kombat\", you can safely assume that if someone else tries to create a group from the exact same string, that they ALSO want to talk about Mortal Kombat, and would be interested in your group anyway.\r\n\r\n>If you were to do a uniqueness check on creation, then it would be possible to steal/subvert groups that are currently offline\r\n\r\nYou don't. The whole point of my suggestion is that the groups are not \"unique\". They are never \"created\". If person A creates a group with the string \"blah\", and then person B attempts to create a group with the string \"blah\", they join the same group as person A, even if they have not coordinate before.\r\n\r\n> it's effectively impossible for two peers to create a group with the same Chat ID.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore, it defeats the purpose of this suggestion.

When you speak of shared secrets it's not automatically assumed that it's okay for random people to accidentally (or intentionally) learn the secret. In crypto-speak a secret has mathematical guarantees to keep it both secret, and unique. \r\n\r\nWith that said, it's not a bad idea, I'll think about whether or not it's feasible using the changes that we've already made to the DHT in the NGC branch. In the mean time, it's trivial with NGC to create a public group and \"disable\" moderation by having the founder exit the group after others join it.

It is indeed technically possible to create a group id based on a group name, allowing anyone to re-generate the group id using just the group name string and use that to join the group. One way to do so is to calculate a 32-byte hash(group-name) digest and use it create the group keypair -- the digest would become the secret key, and the public key, which is the group id, is then calculated off the secret key. However, this has the obvious issue that everyone knowing the group name would know the secret key corresponding to the group id, allowing them to claim to be the group founder, compromising group's moderation capabilities. So while technically possible, this will break group chats, so it's not something we can do.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>A simpler protocol would be to simply derive a DHT key instead, and broadcast presence/bootstrap info on it.\r\n\r\nWhat is the DHT key derived from, the group name? Just making sure I understand you correctly. In this case having it as a DHT Id, i.e. an arbitrary 32-byte string, is enough, you don't need a cryptographic key pair. (Also your comment on the key being symmetric makes no sense, there is no need for a symmetric encryption key).\r\n\r\n>From any currently connected set of peers, a few are chosen to perform periodic broadcast and lookup on the DHT (should be no more costly than online presence announcement), so as to ensure that any \"islands\" on the same key are eventually merged into one group. Any user joining or creating the group (same operation) starts out as an \"island\" of size 1, and eventually merges with the others.\r\n\r\nOk. So, say I create a group called \"Linux\". The information on how to join the group is then stored on the DHT on the nodes closest to the DHT Id of hash(\"Linux\"). Say someone else also creates a group called \"Linux\" and the similar DHT announcement happens. Now, there are two different groups called \"Linux\", each with different group ids, each having different founders, different set of moderators, sanctioned users, group settings: topic lock, voice state, etc. At some point your solution is supposed to merge these two groups, you call them \"islands\", into one. How exactly do you propose to do this? Who will end up being the founder of the resulting group, thus owning the merged group?\r\n\r\nYou could say a group id that is numerically lowest wins the merge, so everyone migrates to that group and its founder keeps being the founder, while the founder and moderators of the group that has lost join as regular users. But this can be gamed -- a malicious user could intentionally generate a group id that has a low numeric value, thus winning the merge and hijacking ownership of someone else's group chat. Pretty much anything you could use to choose which group merges into which can be gamed: group id, number of users in the group, etc. so any script kiddie could easily take over any group chat community on Tox.\r\n\r\nThere are also some other issues with this solution, e.g. name squatting is another one. How do you prevent popular names from being name-squatted by someone creating new group chats? A group of malicious actors could just name-squat all dictionary words, brand names, etc. It's rather challenging to moderate what data gets stored in a distributed system, each node has to make a decision on its own and it has to work in a distributed fashion, Tox developers don't have some magic certificates that all nodes in the Tox network trust and would allow us to moderate the mappings, nor do we want to ever have any such power, there should be no authority in an untrusted distributed network.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyway, as @iphy has said, this is probably better done elsewhere, off the Tox network, as a web API service (e.g. toxme), a blockchain, etc.",

This makes merging the \"islands\" simply a matter of letting each see messages from the others. That is all.\r\n\r\n> There are also some other issues with this solution, e.g. name squatting is another one\r\n\r\nThat is not a problem. Since all users are equal, someone \"squatting\" a name has no more privileges or gains over someone joining later. They are equal. Neither is \"founder\". Both are regular users. A \"squatter\" can do nothing to the group someone joining later can't do.\r\n\r\nAgain, I explained this again and again in this thread, but the point doesn't seem to come through:\r\n\r\nImplicit groups are UNMODERATED.

Jit.si uses a similar system - The default channels are unmoderated, and simply use a randomly (or custom) generated string as the only key. This is, for example, used by the Godot Foundation. Members of which commented: \"If and when someone stirs enough trouble that we need moderation, we'll switch moderated rooms\".\r\n\r\nSecond, is that it's useful as a public forum, like IRC or Matrix. If the point is just to let anyone interested in, then moderation is not the point. In fact, moderation might not even be practical, since a banned user could easily ban-evade by creating a new Tox \"account\". This is because new joiners don't need to be approved. Even if you could somehow truly block a single user, if the public forum is populated enough, there's no a way one person, or a small group of people, could hope to moderate it.\r\n\r\nIn such use cases, where moderation is not a priority, and/or not practical, having the extra speed of \"Just use this clear-purpose human-readable string\" is a much bigger advantage.\r\n\r\nIf this is still not convincing, then you can close it as \"Not planned\" (But not as \"Completed\").",

But can you also then associate that group uniquely with a custom-created string so that anyone else joining (or trying to create) the group can do so without any prior communication from any other person (other than using the same string)?\r\n\r\nThe suggestion here is not _just_ unmoderated groups. It's unmoderated groups that are associated with strings, where any person can join so long as they use the same string. And there's no need to perform a separate operation to create it. From the perspective of a user, a group already \"exists\" for any given string. Entering a \"new\" group is indistinguishable from entering an empty group, i.e. one where all previous users have left.\r\n\r\nTherefore:\r\n- There are no founders (at any point)\r\n- There are no squatters, since an early joiner and a late joiner are equal and protocol-wise indistinguishable\r\n- There is no need for external storage (certainly not for blockchain) because no persistent data needs to be stored for the group\r\n\r\nAnd it gives:\r\n- There's no need to exchange invites, or even group id, or anything. Having the string identifying the group gives everything necessary to join the group.\r\n- Even if you aren't told a string, it is perfectly allowed to try a bunch of random strings to see if a group exists for them. e.g. Common words, popular hash tags, current hot topics, etc. This allows using the feature with true zero coordination.\r\n",

I was even told something to this effect (Including by you):\r\n\r\n> The last one would require some sort of permanent data store within the Tox network, and that's a feature that I don't think there are any plans to implement.\r\n\r\n> You just need to know the group's ID, which may be given to you, or listed publicly somewhere.\r\n\r\n> Name -> ID mapping can be done elsewhere. Indeed that's a rather complicated thing to do securely in an untrusted distributed way (blockchains are one way, and they have significant issues). If you have ideas for it, I'm happy to discuss.\r\n\r\n> At some point your solution is supposed to merge these two groups, you call them \"islands\", into one. How exactly do you propose to do this? Who will end up being the founder of the resulting group, thus owning the merged group?\r\n\r\nAll of the above are issues that stem from the need to _persist_ group information, and the only group information that needs to be persisted is _moderation related_.\r\n\r\nMy solution is to have zero-persistence groups (no need for \"an untrusted distributed way\") by having no \"founder\" that needs persisting. Name->group mapping is done using a deterministic method (e.g. hash, KDF), and nothing else needs to be added or persisted.\r\n\r\nTo the extent of that being possible in NGC, I was told (emphasis mine):\r\n\r\n> One way to do so is to calculate a 32-byte hash(group-name) digest and use it create the group keypair -- the digest would become the secret key, and the public key, which is the group id, is then calculated off the secret key. However, this has the obvious issue that everyone knowing the group name would know the secret key corresponding to the group id, allowing them to claim to be the group founder, *compromising group's moderation capabilities*.\r\n\r\nWhich is a fancy way of saying \"It won't work with NGC because NGC has built-in moderation features that would break it\". This brings us back to this feature not being \"completed\" at all. And no, I'm not misinterpreting it:\r\n\r\n> The new group chat implementation in Tox is moderated, so your proposals won't work with it.\r\n\r\n> You've ignored many of the answers you've been given.\r\n\r\nI've quoted several of them above, and explained why they're irrelevant to this proposal. If I missed one, you'll have to be more specific as to which. Because all I've seen is either \"This is possible with NGC, other than name->group mapping (i.e. the only part that's important)\" or \"Name->group mapping is impossible because moderation (which is not relevant to this proposal)\", to the point where we looped all the way around to \"Groups without moderation are possible in NGC (but without name->group mapping, therefore missing the whole point)\"\r\n\r\nI don't get it. Is there something about my proposal that I'm not explaining properly? Because I'm trying my best to explain every detail. But somehow the main point seems to be getting ignored every time. Just tell me which part was not clear, and I'll do my best to explain it.\r\n",

From everything I've read so far you seem to want yet another groupchat implementation which would require a lot of time to be written and tested. It comes down to the fact that we, as contributors, have limited time to spend developing tox and there are other more critical issues we need to tend to. If you're willing to fund the development of such a feature then make it known and people will arrange that with you. Also, I'd suggest getting familiar with how tox works and possibly it's codebase to understand why what you're asking for is not particularly easy to implement.",

But somehow the main point seems to be getting ignored every time. Just tell me which part was not clear, and I'll do my best to explain it.\r\n\r\nI understand your proposal and I think it's a neat idea -- just like on IRC, multiple users without a prior communication being able to join a chat group based on some common keyword they independently came up with and end up in the same chat group, all done in distributed fashion right on Tox DHT with minimal computational/bandwidth/storage cost,  without querying a web server or a blockchain or some other 3rd party service for the name->group mapping.\r\n\r\nWould be cool if this could be done with the current moderated NGC, but I don't see how we can make it work. It could be that I'm just missing some obvious solution. It would work only with unmoderated group chats, but it's something that would need to get implemented as they don't exist yet (and the old group chats are going to be phased out afaik). Perhaps not entirely from scratch, but modify the existing NGC to allow unmoderated group chats. The value of adding unmoderated group chats is kind of dubious though.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n  - Multiple users can join the same chat room by using the same group name. The group name is entirely made up by the users, it's not a public key / random group id assigned by Tox. For example: \"linux\", \"travel\", \"news\".\r\n\r\nDrawbacks:\r\n  - (Small/Big?) Unmoderated group chats don't exist yet, it's an extra code (or extra casing on top of moderated NGC) that needs to be implemented, tested and maintained.\r\n  - (Big) Such group chats would be unmoderated. @SlugFiller doesn't seem to consider this as a drawback, but I beg to differ. Public forums, reddit, IRC, Matrix are moderated. Heck, even 4chan and Omegle are moderated. You mention a godot group chat, and fair enough, I don't see that many moderation actions taken on Libera IRC (former Freenode) either, but those places are not very representative of an average group chat, people who join such places are typically civil, they join such technical channels to participate in constructive discussions. It would be a different story if it was a gaming related channel, a news/politics related channel, a local city channel, etc. Humans can sometimes be quite the assholes: spamming audio/text, being toxic to others, posting inappropriate things, linking to malware, etc. If someone's first experience with Tox is installing it, joining the \"Overwatch\" (the video game) unmoderated group and being greeted by these kinds of people, I don't think they would be using or recommending Tox to anyone. In fact, Tox might even get publicly known as a lawless place worse than 4chan.\r\n  - (Small) Unmoderated group chats are unique in that they are the only ones that can use names. You can't add friends by names, you have to use Tox ids. You can't join public moderated groups by name, you have to use group ids. ~~You can't private moderated groups by name, you have to use group ids.~~ (Correction: those actually require an invite and can't be joined by a group id, as the whole point of private group chats is that they are not advertised on DHT). So being able to use names for some things but not others might be confusing to users.\r\n\r\nI don't think that trading moderation for the convenience of joining a group chat is a good trade-off. Now, if we could have that benefit without the group chat being unmoderated, then this would be indeed interesting. If I remember right, we had some GSoC students many years ago working on... was it democratic? group chat -- basically a group chats where moderation is done by voting. It isn't as good as founder-based moderation as it can be gamed, but it is something.",

If you'll notice, this suggestion is 6 years old now, and I'm not rushing or pressuring anyone.\r\n\r\nThe problem I have is that it's closed as \"completed\", which implies that this feature already exists in Tox. Which it does not.\r\n\r\nIf this is simply a matter of \"We're busy implementing other stuff, and there's little to no chance of us implementing it\", then it could be closed as \"not planned\". I wouldn't be particularly excited about it, but I'd understand. I wouldn't blame anyone.\r\n\r\nBut closing it as \"completed\" gives the false impression that the feature already exists. This could influence future users who might be looking for that feature, but don't find it anywhere. It could influence future requests for this or similar features which might be closed as \"duplicate\", not by virtue of lack of resources, or failure to match the code base, but rather through a false assumption that the feature is there, but users just can't find it for some reason.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely why GitHub has \"reason\" tags when closing issues.\r\n\r\n> In fact, Tox might even get publicly known as a lawless place worse than 4chan.\r\n\r\nRight now, it has the same reputation as early-days Linux. i.e. You need to be at least this much of a wizard to enter. The fact that Toxic (text-based) is the only client that is actively maintained partially contributes to this.\r\n\r\nIf and when it does hit mainstream, it's going to inherently suffer from the path laid forth by the likes of Telegram. Heck, even the relatively benign Signal has a public impression of some sort of underground. Whenever I say I don't use Whatsapp, I'm asked what I need to hide from the FBI. Basically, that ship has sailed, and it's not coming back.\r\n\r\nWith that said, while a channel named \"Overwatch\" might normally attract a lot of unwanted attention, the fact that you need to be using Tox in order to get to it already filters to a much higher degree than Godot or Libera. People not on the technical/civil side are not likely to be using Tox in the first place.\r\n\r\n> a group chats where moderation is done by voting\r\n\r\nI can't envision any permutation of this that isn't vulnerable to a Sybil attack.\r\n\r\nMaybe PoW, but that's just \"The bigger the machine, the bigger the vote\". By contrast, ban evasion would be trivial, and take almost no resources at all. Especially if using Tox over Tor.",
