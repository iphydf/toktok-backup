Without having to know anything about Python or how the Python bindings work, I can tell with with 100% certainty that there are only three possibilities: \r\n\r\n1. You're running an old version of toxcore that doesn't do a null check\r\n2. There is a bug that causes `tcp_c` to be nulled while the groupchat is still running\r\n3. There is memory corruption\r\n\r\nI just built toxcore with the build options you specified above, and ran toxic over a SOCKS proxy. I was able to join a groupchat without issue and did not get any segfaults. I'm going to need your help here. You seem to be able to reproduce this segfault in your own environment consistently, so it shouldn't be hard to figure out how to trigger it in other clients, as you insist that the issue is with toxcore, and not your client. Once you can tell me how to reproduce the segfault in toxic, then I can easily fix it. \r\n\r\n",
