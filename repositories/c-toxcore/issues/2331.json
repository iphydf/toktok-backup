It doesn't work AFAIK behind SOCKS - [I can't even build it behind SOCKS](https://github.com/Tox/ToxStatus/issues/31) -:) \r\n\r\nThe issue here is testing a BS node whilst behind a SOCKS proxy. I can reach a TCP port on a BS node over SOCKS but I don't have a simple way of getting a meaningful reply out of a simple utility written easily in any language - Python in this example.\r\n\r\nUDP you can send a packet of len 78 with the magic first bytes and get a version and MOTD reply. What little I understood, the TCP handshake is much more complex, too complex for my usecase. I asked @Green-Sky  to add it as from looking at the UDP reply code it can't be \"much\" work.\r\n\r\nIt's important as this is a complete blocker for me to testing a simple way of providing BS nodes over OnionV3 which will help our resiliency. It's pretty easy to block our small number or nodes, and it's very easy for poisoned guard or exit nodes to try to block Tox *over* Tor. What I'm trying to explore is Tox *in* Tor, which should be more tamper resistant.\r\n\r\nPS: nice to see a command-line tool for Tox; I just added a Python console to [toxygen](https://git.plastiras.org/emdee/toxygen) so it's a command-line CLI for anything wrapped into tox_wrapper.",

This can be done right now if you want to get a testbed in place to test against.\r\n\r\nConfigure your boostrap server with an extra tcp_port that is not listed publically in the nodes.json file. We will use 33446 as an example.\r\n\r\nIn your /etc/tor/torrc or equivalent, you need to add 2 sections.\r\n\r\nThe first is:\r\n```\r\nVirtualAddrNetworkV4 10.192.0.0/10\r\nAutomapHostsOnResolve 1\r\nAutomapHostsSuffixes .exit,.onion\r\n```\r\nThe second is:\r\n```\r\n# Tox hidden service configuration.\r\nHiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/tox-hsv3/\r\nHiddenServicePort 33446 127.0.0.1:33446\r\n```\r\nReplace 33446 with your real port number.\r\n\r\nThe next time tor starts up, a new directory will be created in /var/lib/tor/tox-hsv3/ and it will have a file called hostname. Look in the file for the onion address to your site.\r\n\r\nNow add the onion address followed by a colon and the port  to the motd field of the advertised nodes.json entry for your server",
