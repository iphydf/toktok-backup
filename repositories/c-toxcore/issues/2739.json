The following options are experimental\r\n2. Options marked \"experimental\" may change behavior or get removed\r\n3. Options marked \"experimental\" may be renamed to something non-experimental if they become part of the supported API\r\n\r\nThis sounds like all the options below that comment must be marked as \"experimental\" since they are all experimental.\r\n\r\nBelow we see `experimental_groups_persistence` and `experimental_thread_safety`, so by \"marked experimental\" I assume it means having the `experimental_` prefix.\r\n\r\nHowever, the `operating_systems` option is not prefixed with `experimental_`. Its naming goes against what the comment says -- that all options below the comment are experimental and thus are marked as experimental.\r\n\r\nDue to (3), one might think that perhaps it was experimental at some point but has became a part of the supported API since it's not marked as experimental and someone just forgot to move it above the experimental section of `Tox_Options`. But apparently it is in fact an experimental option https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/pull/2735#issuecomment-1987427061.\r\n\r\nSo I'm left very confused as what is going on with the experimental section. It's not coherent and contradicts itself. Something needs to be done to clear this up before the .19 release as this might be API breaking change depending on how it's handled, e.g. if we end up renaming `operating_systems` to `experimental_operating_systems`, along with the get/set functions.",

Now that I look into it, there is no way for clients to use `const Tox_System *operating_system`, even when building with `-DEXPERIMENTAL_API=ON`, i.e. with `tox_private.h` included.\r\n\r\n`Tox_System *` is an opaque pointer in `tox.h` and there are no functions defined on it, there are only a getter and setter of it for `Tox_Options`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/ad4921dbaa2d8c98d9c3b89a113da244064f4d11/toxcore/tox.h#L508-L515\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/ad4921dbaa2d8c98d9c3b89a113da244064f4d11/toxcore/tox.h#L762-L764\r\n\r\nSimilar thing is happening in `tox_private.h`, while the struct is now defined, it consists mainly of opaque pointers:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/ad4921dbaa2d8c98d9c3b89a113da244064f4d11/toxcore/tox_private.h#L19-L34\r\n\r\nA client at most has access to the following headers (taken from the docker-windows-mingw CI):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    |-- [4.0K]  include\r\n    |   `-- [4.0K]  tox\r\n    |       |-- [177K]  tox.h\r\n    |       |-- [ 10K]  tox_dispatch.h\r\n    |       |-- [ 26K]  tox_events.h\r\n    |       |-- [6.4K]  tox_private.h\r\n    |       |-- [ 26K]  toxav.h\r\n    |       `-- [ 12K]  toxencryptsave.h\r\n```   \r\n\r\nA client has no definitions for `struct Random`, `struct Network` and `struct Memory`, so with the little definitions that `tox_private.h` gives, clients are able to at most modify `tox_mono_time_cb *mono_time_callback` and `void *mono_time_user_data`, which is not very useful.\r\n\r\n(Please correct me if I'm wrong and we actually assume that if a client has access to `tox_private.h` then they also have access to all of `toxcore/*.h` headers to get definitions of all the opaque structs, in which case I should modify the docker-windows-mingw CI to copy all the `toxcore/*.h` headers into `include/`.)\r\n\r\nIt looks like `Tox_Options.operating_system` is primarily used by tests, which have definitions for `struct Random`, `struct Network` and `struct Memory` as they include `toxcore/*.h` headers and thus can replace them with custom implementations.\r\n\r\nIf there is no way for a client to use `Tox_Options.operating_system` and its primarily use is for testing, it begs the question why `Tox_Options.operating_system` and `Tox_System *` are in `tox.h` at all. This seems like a wrong place for something like this. They belong in `tox_private.h`, or perhaps even a new non-installable `tox_testing.h`, if things in `tox_private.h` are supposed to be usable without inclusion of any of other private toxcore headers like `network.h`, `mem.h` and such. This is very sloppy.",
