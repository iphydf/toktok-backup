Because as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#TCP_segment_structure) says:\r\n\r\n> At the lower levels of the protocol stack, due to network congestion, traffic load balancing, or other unpredictable network behaviour, IP packets may be lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order. TCP detects these problems, requests re-transmission of lost data, rearranges out-of-order data and even helps minimize network congestion to reduce the occurrence of the other problems. If the data still remains undelivered, the source is notified of this failure. Once the TCP receiver has reassembled the sequence of octets originally transmitted, it passes them to the receiving application. Thus, TCP abstracts the application's communication from the underlying networking details.",

If the chance is >0%, the user has to deal with consequences of sending it. Big difference.\r\n\r\nThis is just one example.",
