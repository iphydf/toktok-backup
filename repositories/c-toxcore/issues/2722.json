Users can also use the ignore feature to mute individuals including founders and mods.\r\n\r\nThe observer list can grow pretty big (in fact I can't remember if we ever purge it at some limit) so it probably wouldn't be a good idea to implement auto-observer-on-join without first resolving that issue. That list gets synced between peers, so limiting its size is important if you're going to be growing it indefinitely.",
