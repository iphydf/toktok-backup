But there is something I cannot understand.\r\nYou claim that the protocol is completely peer to peer and end-to-end encrypted. The question is, how is it even possible? Due to my knowledge of cryptography, there is no (regular) way to prevent man in the middle in absence of a CA in peer to peer encrypted communications. So it would be appreciated if you could enlighten me about this matter.\r\nIsn't it possible for an adversary (maybe an evil ISP, for example) to sit between users and play the role of man in the middle in this protocol?",

There is no CA for trust delegation, therefore trust establishment needs to happen out-of-band. If these public keys are exchanged via an insecure channel, an adversary may be able to perform a MitM attack. Please note that this is also the case e.g. when using Signal (that's why you need to compare _safety numbers_ in Signal).\r\nStatic long-term X25519 keys are then used in the Tox protocol to exchange per-session ephemeral X25519 public keys, which are subsequently used to generate a symmetric session secret to be used with XSalsa-Poly1305 for AEAD encryption. \r\nThe current authenticated key exchange (AKE) in the Tox protocol is vulnerable to so-called \"Key Compromise Impersonation\" (KCI) attacks. KCI could _potentially_ be used to mount MitM attacks, _after_ a static long-term private key of a peer gets compromised. If you are interested in details in regard to KCI, see https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/426#issuecomment-759511593",
