If `tox_bootstrap()` fails to send a packet, then `tox_bootstrap()` return value should indicate failure.\r\n\r\n>This results in tox_boostrap returning true for me, as count is always 1, and then the client (qTox in my case) reporting that I'm successfully connected to the DHT.\r\n\r\nNow, I think you are confusing something here. The `tox_bootstrap()` call doesn't tell whether you have successfully bootstraped or not, all it does it just sending a packet somewhere. You don't know if you have successfully bootstrapped until toxcore's main loop runs for a few iterations and it processes the packets it has received from the bootstrap nodes replying to the packet you have sent in `tox_bootstrap()`. If toxcore does get response from bootstrap nodes, toxcore calls the callback you have set using [`tox_friend_connection_status_cb`](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/fc0cc08b2115d037551369f69519e95e841643aa/toxcore/tox.h#L1566) saying that it got connected. If toxcore doesn't get any response from bootstrap nodes, it doesn't call the callback. Most clients wait for some about of time and if they weren't told by toxcore that they have went online, they will assume that bootstrapping failed and will try to re-bootstrap. They don't interpret the success return value of `tox_bootstrap()` as the fact that they did indeed successfully bootstrapped and are now connected to the DHT. If some client does that, then they are doing it wrong. Pretty sure qTox doesn't (at least didn't in the past) do that.",

It is indeed a bit misleading in the setting of using Tox on a local network with just 2 peers, as when one peer goes offline, the other peer's toxcore will also go offline as it wouldn't be connected to any active node anymore. The person behind the second peer might think that there is something wrong with their network or the Tox client since it says that they are offline, but everything is actually fine, it's just that there is no one else that the Tox client is connected to.",
