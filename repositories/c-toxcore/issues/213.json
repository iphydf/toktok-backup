            "body": "- _It tells new contributors, \"guilty until proven innocent,\"_ - Yes, and for a security-sensitive project, this seems like the right approach, at least for code.\n- _If they can keep out potential competitors by delaying and blocking their patches, they will._ - We have not historically, and will not intentionally delay or block patches. I think we are a welcoming community, and we add basically anyone who intends to contribute to the Contributors team, making it possible for them to work on issues (assign, close, assign labels, etc.), create branches (discouraged but possible). This open mindset has so far proven very useful. As you can see, @SkyzohKey has added a label to this issue. I do think \"trusted until proven guilty\" is good for all this kind of management stuff, but not for code.\n- _It opens the door to discrimination_ - We have been \"aggressively inclusive\", as described above. We actively counter-act any kind of discrimination, and expect respectful behaviour on all communication platforms.\n- _It slows down the learning cycle_ - Iterating on features and ideas can be done in forks. This is one of the things that makes github great. The master branch in the TokTok repository is where we put well-tested code that can ideally be shipped at any time. Indeed we do introduce bugs sometimes, and then quickly fix them. Versions are used to pin specific points in time when we are reasonably sure that everything works correctly. I think a staged approach like this makes sense: unstable experimental development on user forks; reviewed and tested code on master; carefully tested code in version tags/releases.\n- _It gives outsiders the chance to troll the project_ - Can you explain how this is related? I don't see the link between patch management and trolling.\n- _It puts the burden of work on individual contributors_ - What kind of work? Indeed, the burden of producing high quality code is on the contributor. It is not reasonable to expect the maintainer to merge a patch and then proceed to clean up the mess.\n\n\"Good contributors who know the rules and write excellent, perfect patches.\" - These don't exist. Nobody always writes perfect patches.\n\nThe above is my opinion. We can try a different approach, if someone proposes and implements an approach that lets us retain code quality requirements, keep the maintenance burden acceptable, and still apply \"optimistic merging\".\n",

            "body": "TL;DR Just read the bold paragraph.\n\nThe author of the blog is an idiot. (This and the following opinions are my own and do not reflect the views of anyone but me) This is a paragraph he started with\n\n> I recommend to merge quickly, without waiting for Continuous Integration testing to finish, and without review of the code. \n\nHe's advocating to make all projects world writable by default. If you dont understand why that could be problematic, perhaps a security focused project is not where you should start.\n\n> Standard practice (Pessimistic Merging, or PM) is to wait until CI is done, then do a code review, then test the patch on a branch, and then provide feedback to the author. The author can then fix the patch and the test/review cycle starts again.\n\nThe assertion that there is good code, and bad code is a fact. If you want more evidence look at my #200 pull request. There were a lot of issues with my pull that have already been fixed, and a lot more that need to be fixed. I wrote a mess of imperfect code.\n\nCI exists to be the bare minimum of code review, and ours take 5-15m if you're unwilling to wait 5-15m before adding code to a project that tens of thousands of people use monthly, a number of them who believe their lives depends on it's quality and security. Then I dont want your contributions. (Again my own opinions, other developers here will still support you)\n\nGood code review takes time, our process allows anyone, be they experts with strict attention to detail @iphydf or people who are teaching themselves to write code @SkyzohKey @endoffile78 @Grayhatter. And with the requirements we have everyone learns what good code is, and their contributions are supported valued and improved. During the pull request phase.\n\n> At this stage the maintainer can (and often does) make value judgments such as \"I don't like how you do this\" or \"this doesn't fit with our project vision.\"\n\nYeah, and if they have good reasons, I'll support their value judgments. If they dont I'll likely mock them for it. If someone opened a pull request for a very impressive c# pathing algorithm. Should we merge that, even if it doesn't fit in with our project vision?\n\n> \"guilty until proven innocent,\" which is a negative message that creates negative emotions. \n\nWer'e all adults here, code matters feelings not so much https://github.com/domgetter/NCoC\n\n> It opens the door to discrimination. One can argue, a project belongs to its maintainers, so they can choose who they want to work with. My response is: projects that are not aggressively inclusive will die, and deserve to die. \n\nI'm not sure if the author knows this is a point in support of Pessimistic merging. either way see my previous point\n\n> It slows down the learning cycle. Innovation demands rapid experiment-failure-success cycles. Someone identifies a problem or inefficiency in a product. Someone proposes a fix. The fix is tested and works or fails. We have learned something new. The faster this cycle happens, the faster and more accurately the project can move.\n\nThis is flatlly wrong. I dont have time to review whole files ar go commit by commit to provide feedback in a disjointed way. I do have tme to review pull requests. See my previous comments about how code review add to learning.\n\n> It puts the burden of work on individual contributors, which is ironic and sad for open source. \n\nIt's not ironic\n\n> We want to work together yet we're told to fix our work alone.\n\nNo you're not. The recurring format we often use is 'why'? Why did you do it like this. See all of jfreegmans comments on #200 provide your rational here. We'll provide all the support you need to finish your pull to be included. Some of the people who contribute also have taken over others abandoned pull requests.\n\n> Now let's see how this works when we use Optimistic Merge. To start with, understand that not all patches nor all contributors are the same. We see at least four main cases in our open source projects:\n> \n> Good contributors who know the rules and write excellent, perfect patches.\n\nThis doesn't exists.\n\n> Good contributors who make mistakes, and who write useful yet broken patches.\n\nThis is everyone else\n\n> Mediocre contributors who make patches that no-one notices or cares about.\n\nDoesn't exist on all of toktok.\n\n> Trollish contributors who ignore the rules, and who write toxic patches.\n\nTrolls don't open pull requests, it's too much work.\n\nThe blog author's premise is flawed, making his conclusions irrelevant, or wrong. \n\n> PM: depending on unspecified, arbitrary criteria, patch may be merged rapidly or slowly. At least sometimes, a good contributor will be left with bad feelings. OM: good contributors feel happy and appreciated, and continue to provide excellent patches until they are done using the project.\n\nI don't care about your feeling, just code. Either way, if you want you contribution accepted, and are willing to put in the work to bring it up to the highest lever our existing developers can ask for. We'll put in the time explaining and helping you to get it there. Then we'll say thank you when we merge your work. (and likely start asking your opinion on things as well) It's unfortunate that requiring only excellent code gets merged hurts your feeling, but I'd rather have a project that I can trust than one that makes people feel good about poor quality work. \n\n**Working with toxcore we do need developers, but only good developers. And as I said, all developers make mistakes, so a good developer is one who want's to learn, and fix every mistake they can.**\n\n> PM: contributor retreats, fixes patch, comes back somewhat humiliated. OM: second contributor joins in to help first fix their patch. We get a short, happy patch party. New contributor now has a coach and friend in the project.\n\nAnd if no one notices, a broken commit lives on in the code base for 9 years http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/10/most-serious-linux-privilege-escalation-bug-ever-is-under-active-exploit/\n\n> PM: we get a flamewar and everyone wonders why the community is so hostile. OM: the mediocre contributor is largely ignored. If patch needs fixing, it'll happen rapidly. Contributor loses interest and eventually the patch is reverted.\n\nThis only allows anyone to dump bad code and leave, without ever learning about why it's bad. Then the good developers are stuck only fixing bad issues which can pop up anywhere (because we're ignoring CI and reviews remember) instead of working on things that is more deserving of their time.\n\n> PM: we get a flamewar which troll wins by sheer force of argument. Community explodes in fight-or-flee emotions. Bad patches get pushed through. OM: existing contributor immediately reverts the patch. There is no discussion. Troll may try again, and eventually may be banned. Toxic patches remain in git history forever.\n\nLock, ban, delete. It's not censorship, it proper forum maintenance. \n\n> In each case, OM has a better outcome than PM.\n> In the majority case (patches that need further work), Optimistic Merge creates the conditions for mentoring and coaching. And indeed this is what we see in ZeroMQ projects, and is one of the reasons they are such fun to work on.\n\nNo, this is wrong for the reasons I gave above.\n\n> People before code: build the right community and it will build the right code.\n\nNo... Good, well run projects attract good developers, good communities attract good people. \n\n> Progress before consensus: look for processes that work without upfront consensus (except on rules).\n\nNO another reason I think the author is an idiot.\n",

I am therefore reluctant to choose a different strategy at this time. Thanks for bringing this article to our attention, I think it has been good to discuss the ideas in them.\n\nI will close this since there is no action we can take right now. Please reopen the issue or open a new one (or better yet: [come talk to us](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=toktok)) if you feel that our community is hostile to contributors.\n",
