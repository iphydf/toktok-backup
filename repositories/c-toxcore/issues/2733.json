Your Tox instance would stop all the processing and responding to network requests, so to others it would seem as if you suddenly lost the Internet connection and you will eventually time out and be shown as offline on their end.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go offline immediately however, without others still seeing you as being online until some timeout amount of time passes on their end, the Tox instance would need to send packets to others telling that it's shutting down, which is done only when the Tox instance is destroyed, there is no option to send those without destroying it. What you can do in this case to still access the Tox struct is re-create it back after destroying it but with network settings that prevent it from connecting to anything. So before you destroy the Tox instance you would call `tox_get_savedata()` to save its state, then destroy the Tox instance, then create a new Tox instance off the saved state, with UDP and LAN discovery options disabled and a bogus proxy that Tox would fail to connect to specified, avoiding calling any bootstrap/add_tcp_relay function calls as that would be pointless without a network.",
