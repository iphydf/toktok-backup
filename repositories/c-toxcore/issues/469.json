            "body": "Here is a summary of what changes need to be done in toxcore in order to resolve this issue.\r\n\r\nWhen using SOCKS5 proxy, there are 3 cases when the name resolution is done:\r\n\r\n1. Resolving address of the SOCKS5 proxy.\r\n2. Resolving address of bootstrap nodes.\r\n3. Resolving address of TCP relays.\r\n\r\nIn case 1, toxcore can't connect at all unless it uses DNS without tunneling it through a proxy in order to resolve proxy's IP address. We could require the SOCKS5 proxy address in `Tox_Options` to be an IP address. `tox_new()` would just fail if SOCKS5's address is a hostname. Alternatively, we could add an option to `Tox_Options` to force DNS resolution though the SOCKS5 proxy. `tox_new()` would still fail if SOCKS5's address is a hostname and the DNS is forced to go though the SOCKS5 proxy, but it would succeed in case DNS is not forced to go though the proxy.\r\n\r\nIn case 2, we need to implement a `getaddrinfo()` replacement that works through SOCKS5. We would need to communicate with DNS servers, meaning we would need to construct request packets and parse the replies according to the [DNS protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035). We would also need to know addresses of DNS servers to use. Because there is no single cross-platform way to get the addresses of system DNS servers, toxcore could just offload the burden of getting those to the clients and provide a new option in `Tox_Options` for specifying addresses of DNS servers for toxcore to use to resolve domain names through SOCKS5 proxy. The way this would work is toxcore would request the SOCKS5 proxy to make a tunnel to TCP port 53 of the DNS specified in `Tox_Options`, then we would send the name resolution request packet to the DNS server through that tunnel, and receive the resolved IP address back.\r\n\r\nIn case 3, toxcore could just not resolve the address of TCP relays at all, as, in addition to IPv4 and IPv6, SOCKS5 also allows specifying hostname of the machine you want to establish the tunnel to ([`DOMAINNAME` in the RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1928#section-4)).",

As I said in https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/469#issuecomment-278857189 in the 3rd case, you indeed don't have to do the name resolution for the TCP relays you want to connect though SOCKS5 proxy, because you can just tell the SOCKS5 proxy to connect to a hostname (`DOMAINNAME` in the RFC).\r\n\r\nThe issue is in the 2nd case of https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/469#issuecomment-278857189. It seems that toxcore requires you to perform bootstrap even if you use a TCP relay:\r\n\r\n> [This function will attempt to connect to the node using UDP. You must use this function even if Tox_Options.udp_enabled was set to false.](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/995578f1038842288c1ff552fd796ab2377db6e1/toxcore/tox.h#L892-L893)\r\n\r\nIn order to bootstrap off the DHT botostrap nodes, toxcore needs to resolve their hostnames. And no, it appears toxcore doesn't connect to the DHT bootstrap nodes through SOCKS5 proxy. DHT is UDP-only. So you can't connect using hostname, you have to actually do the name resolution, get IP address and use that. But toxcore also shouldn't send anything in clearnet when a proxy is enabled and UDP is disabled, so it should connect to those bootstrap nodes directly. I'm somewhat unfamiliar with how toxcore DHT works, but it might be the case that the TCP relay node, to which we are connected through SOCKS5 proxy, acts as a DHT relay and it expects all addresses of DHT nodes you send to it to be in IPv4 or IPv6.",

The answer is yes, because in addition to TCP relays (`tox_add_tcp_relay()`), toxcore also needs to know addresses of UDP onion nodes in order to work correctly. The DHT, however, is not used when UDP is disabled. `tox_bootstrap()` function resolves the address passed to it as argument and calls `onion_add_bs_node_path()` and `DHT_bootstrap()` functions. Although calling `DHT_bootstrap()` is not really necessary as DHT is not used, we still need to resolve the address of the DHT node in order to populate the onion routes with `onion_add_bs_node_path()` call. This means that we have to implement our own `getaddrinfo()` that communicates with DNS servers through a SOCKS5 proxy. (Alternatively, we could modify Tox protocol to allow sending of hostnames, in addition to IPv4 and IPv6.)",

There's a way of simplifying the problem a bit to move forward: let's assume the SOCKS proxy is Tor, which is probably the majority of users right now. \r\n\r\nCorporate SOCKS proxies will require usernames and passwords which are not currently supported - for corporate proxies you will also need to do DNS resolution through the proxy. The normal configuration of Tor does not so we're OK for now. And the normal configuration of Tor has an IP address for the proxy so we don't have to worry about DNS lookup of the proxy. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you configure Tor to do so, it will run a DNS server for you, UDP (and TCP?) on any port you choose using the  ```DNSPort 127.0.0.1:9053``` config option.\r\n\r\nSo you can just write a documentation section for using Tox over Tor to describe DNSPort with Tor as the way of using Tox over Tor without leaking DNS queries *if* you extend ToxOptions to accept a IP/port for the DNS.\r\nThat should be easy to do. But this would be for the BS operators only, not the Tox clients using Tor.\r\n\r\nBut @nurupo went on to say\r\n>  (Alternatively, we could modify Tox protocol to allow sending of hostnames, in addition to IPv4 and IPv6.) \r\n\r\nThis may be really important to do for another reason: adding the ability of Tox to easily use Tor ```.onion``` addresses for TCP_RELAY and bootstrap nodes. Adding .onion addresses is crucial for Tox as it is so easy now to block as it has so few relays and nodes. There are workarounds for this problem with Tor configuration for the node operators, but they are not straightforward and user friendly - modifying Tox protocol to allow sending of hostnames would be much better, and would be required if you were to help people in places like Iran, where the country is an  Intranet, albeit with Tor.\r\n\r\nSo we can move forward by :\r\n1. Modifying Tox_Options to take a DNS ip/port.\r\n2. Modifying Tox protocol to allow sending of hostnames, including onions.\r\n\r\n",

It would require making `addr_resolve()`, and by extension `addr_resolve_or_parse_ip()`, asynchronous. Them not being able to return the resolved address to the caller but instead having to schedule a DNS resolution, requiring a few `tox_iterate()/do_tcp_connection()` loops in order to resolve it, already makes the change non-trivial as the current code expects to get the addresses resolved right there and then, in some cases even before `tox_iterate()/do_tcp_connection()` is called for the first time and before any proxy connection is established.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf someone decides to tackle this for the general case of using a custom user-specified DNS server, via clearnet and proxy, they would find out that there is no standard API for asynchronous DNS: glibc has [`getaddrinfo_a()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getaddrinfo_a.3.html), but that's a GNU extension and [musl libc doesn't support it](https://git.musl-libc.org/cgit/musl/tree/src/network?h=v1.2.4), and obviously [Windows has its own different way](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/windns/nf-windns-dnsqueryex) of doing async DNS, and maybe macOS too, and so on. If the DNS spec is simple enough, it would be preferable to implement our own async stub DNS resolver. Otherwise we could use a 3rd party cross-platform asynchronous DNS resolution library for this, like [c-ares](https://c-ares.org/) or [something else](https://c-ares.org/otherlibs.html).",

I assumed getting an answer would be no more complex than the current SOCK5 connect negotiation because it's the same port and protocol.\r\n\r\nStill I think this is an important issue and should be mentioned in the README; many Tor users are naive about DNS leaks while using Tor, and very few with have UDP+TCP firewalls in place, which are hard to do and even harder to test. We've had help requests in IRC from people in places like Iran so it can be crucial. I'll publicize the fact that you need a firewall if you want anonymity with Tor so people don't get burned.\r\n\r\n(I see 8 packages on my Linux that use c-ares and it runs on  POSIX including arm sparc s390 and macos, Windows, and Android )\r\n\r\nDo all the complications you listed apply to having the code get its DNS from other than 127,0.0.1:53? Tor is easily configured to provide DNS on 127.0.0.1:9053 UDP if that helps; we could \"easily\" add a SOCKS_DNS_HOST and SOCKS_DNS_PORT. \r\n\r\nI leave it in your capable hands but I'd hate for it to take another 6 years for this to be fixed.\r\n",

(You might even put the C code that reads a file of IP:port BSnodes into the library so all clients can use it.) The bash script could look at socks_proxy in the environment and write the IP:ports file accordingly before ctest is run. In most cases this is a once-and-done step.\r\n\r\nTo deal with this (six year old) security issue one solution would be to make the library code deal only with IP addresses: no calls by c-toxcore to do DNS lookups. That would be the client's job, and you could write it into the client spec.\r\n\r\nThe clients could do the lookup of the nodes list, using tor-resolve or not, and cache the result. The clients could each make its decision on what async DNS library code to use, e.g. c-ares, or python code or java libraries etc. Hopefully all the clients will stop using compiled in nodelists at the same time. It's not a problem for toxygen: it already either uses it's own code for tor, or I call something for non-SOCKs. The c-toxcore stays clean and safe of this security issue.\r\n\r\nYou'd have to do some planning for this:\r\n* Make the decision\r\n* Modify the client spec\r\n* Get the clients to plan implementation schedules\r\n* Set a schedule for the phaseout of DNS lookups by c-toxcore.\r\n* Cut off DNS lookups and test.\r\n* Mark this issue as completed.\r\n\r\nThere's an advantage to doing this: for tox-in-tor\r\n\r\n> This may be really important to do for another reason: adding the ability of Tox to easily use Tor .onion addresses for TCP_RELAY and bootstrap nodes. Adding .onion addresses is crucial for Tox as it is so easy now to block as it has so few relays and nodes. \r\n\r\nThe code that resolves names to IPs in tor will handle .onion addresses for Tox-in-Tor, something I doubt c-toxcore will ever do. So you would get defacto .onion address compatability if you did this. \r\n",

We could create a `TCP_Client`-like object that is just TCP socket with proxy connection logic (i.e. `TCP_Client` sans all the Tox crypto and handshake bits), which would be used exclusively for SOCKS5 hostname resolution within `addr_resolve()`. Created once and reused in all consecutive `addr_resolve()` calls. `addr_resolve()` would send a `DOMAINNAME` requests to the proxy (after authenticating with it if required) and block until it receives a reply with the corresponding IP address, or an error, or some timeout passes. Blocking the call awaiting a networking reply is widely inefficient than doing so asynchronously, but it should be somewhat comparable to `getaddrinfo()` `addr_resolve()` already does, albeit slower, as the initial lookup will require a TCP handshake and might require SOCKS5 authentication (with following lookups reusing the connection), and TCP is generally slower anyway.",

I gave it a bit of thought and I think it is possible to make SOCKS5 hostname lookups synchronous without breaking a lot of things...\r\n\r\nI think so, especially if you cache the result and it's only probably  a half dozen lookups per Tox lifetime. I looked at the C-toxcore code to do a SOCKs connect once and although I'm no good at C, I know the Python code is dead simple and must be less complex than the existing c-core SOCKs connect code. The existing connect code should be reusable with some command-response byte changes. And you have a working \"reference\" implementation in Python.\r\n\r\nTor circuits can be slow but the lookups are immediate. And if the user is using tox over tor, he's in no hurry anyway :=,)\r\n\r\nIf you go that route can you keep open to the likelihood that the node names may be .onion addresses for tox-in-tor? I don't see tox caring about what's in a name, except they are long (62b). You can do longterm mapping of onion addresses to spoofed IPs in a given reserved range in tor with a little tinkering on torrc.",

The idea here was that toxcore would by default not provide DNS lookup functions, but a client implementer could still provide their own. Not sure if this is worth doing, considering that the client implementer can just resolve them before handing them to toxcore though.",

Could you look into the possibility of doing it?\r\n\r\nNot sure what you mean by \"tor lookups\". If you mean using a Tor-aware SOCKS5 proxy to connect to TCP relays via their .onion addresses by passing those .onion directly to the proxy without toxcore doing the name resolution, then yes, this is possible. This doesn't fit the current `tox_add_tcp_relay()` API behavior though, some sort of a `Tox_Options` flag or a new versions of `tox_add_tcp_relay()`, e.g. `tox_add_tcp_relay_proxyresolve()` would need to be added to make this work. It's also at odds with https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/469#issuecomment-1945500543 not accepting any hostnames in API starting with 0.3.0, though maybe it could make an exception for them to be passed to proxies?\r\n\r\n>@robinlinden Are you putting together some release notes for the 0.2.19 release? If so, could you do a section on 'upcoming changes' and put your version of the steps I outlined? There could be a list of planned incompatabilities for 0.3.0.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make much sense to announce a list of planned changes for 0.3.0 in 0.2.19's release notes if we are unsure of what they will be yet ourselves. We have some ideas, but they might change when implementing them or when they clash with other changes we want to see in 0.3.0. It's also not known when 0.3.0 will release, for all I know we might continue working on 0.2.20, 0.2.21, etc. for a while now, working on changes that don't necessitate API breakage, meanwhile doing a better job on documenting what breaking changes we want to do in 0.3.0 by opening [milestoned issues](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av0.3.0) so that we don't forget about them and so that we could discuss them before they are implemented. API breaking changes  are important changes, having them being scattered all around IRC, groupchats, random PR and Issue discussions (like the mentioning of https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/469#issuecomment-1945500543 in here), or not even not being discussed at all but being in developers' heads and then dropping as a surprise fully implemented PR, is not very good. While it works for regular changes, for the API-breaking ones we really should keep a list of them all and be able to discuss if needed. Anyway, I got a little side-tracked here.",

Toxcore doesn't read files. It provides API allowing to specify IP and port, so just have clients read a file and call the appropriate API functions.

If you mean using a Tor-aware SOCKS5 proxy to connect to TCP relays via their .onion addresses by passing those .onion directly to the proxy without toxcore doing the name resolution, then yes, this is possible. \r\n\r\nA \"tor lookup\" is when you resolve an .onion address to an IP that is stable during the lifetime of a Tor process (usually long - longer than a Tox  client except maybe a BSdaemon). \r\n\r\n```\r\ntor-resolve  -4 facebookwkhpilnemxj7asaniu7vnjjbiltxjqhye3mhbshg7kx5tfyd.onion\r\n172.18.155.197\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat IP is good for the lifetime of the Tor instance and the IP is what would be passed to Tox for a BS .onion via an external nodelist for .onion BS addresses with tox-in-tor.
