            "body": "If it's not just for TokTok/c-toxcore, I would argue that it's better to have per-project PGP keys and contact information. You need to realize that there are a lot of Tox-based projects, so handing a single PGP secret key to developers of all those projects and subscribing them to receive vulnerability disclosures not only of their, but also of all all other projects doesn't sound like a good idea. There would easily be 15-50 developers who would have the PGP key and access to the mailbox. Assuming none of the developers are malicious, it would take someone to hack just one developer to get access to all vulnerability disclosures of all Tox-related projects, since all of them use the same key and the same mailbox. Or someone malicious could start developing something Tox-related to legitimately get access to all vulnerability disclosures of all Tox-related projects.\r\n\r\nI think its the responsibility of each Tox-based project to handle vulnerability disclosures on their own. We could setup a wiki page for developers to add their own public keys/fingerprints and contact information and direct people who want to report vulnerabilities to that, with an option to PGP-email to security@tox.chat if that wiki page doesn't work out for them for any reason. What do you say about that?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you meant just TokTok/c-toxcore, a single Tox project, then yes, that's a good idea.There are about 2 active toxcore developers that I'd trust with vulnerability disclosure info on toxcore: iphy and robinli, so they could share a single PGP key between each other and we could setup a email forwarder at security-toxcore@tox.chat which would forward everything to their emails. Alternatively, since there are just 2 of them anyway, it also sounds reasonable enough to ask anyone disclosing TokTok/c-toxcore vulnerabilities to PGP-encrypt their email for 2 different keys and send to it to 2 mailboxes -- iphy's and robinli's.",
