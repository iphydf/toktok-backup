It is better to have persistent storage IMO in the general case.\r\n\r\nI will release qTox with defragmenter once I will work out few remaining problems.\r\n\r\nI also think that it is better to have a mid-level library, xtox, that will contain defragmenter itself to allow other clients to use it. This assumes that all clients use sqlite. I am not sure if this is a reasonable assumption.\r\n\r\nThis xtox library could export another version of Tox interface that will allow large messages. \r\nBug https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/499 is a pre-requisite for such library.",

Will add more tests later.\r\n\r\nNow any client is able to use defragmenter.\r\n\r\nDo you think the dependency pull requests for toxcore and qTox can be merged?\r\nOnce they are merged, I can create the pull request for qTox with the option to enable long messages.\r\n\r\nI would like to add the file attachment feature in qTox, like in e-mail. It will be able to send file attachments in MIME format. But I can't proceed with this without the ability to send large messages.\r\n",

Perhaps via the Tox Message API is the wrong way?\r\n\r\nMaybe a file/document?\r\n\r\nSure you COULD send files and such via tox messages, but if your solution to doing so is; interface with a SQL database, instead of the existing file transfer API.
