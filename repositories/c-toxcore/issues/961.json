Normally if I lost connection to a group, I should just be reconnected, but here that never happens.

I believe I see the problem now: \nmessages from a particular peer come with a \"message number\", \nincremented with each message from that peer, and messages with too old \na message number are ignored by other peers. The current message number \nis saved in the savedata, but if there's a crash and the peer restarts \nfrom an old save file, they'll start from an old message number and so \nother peers will ignore them. In particular they ignore the kill message \nthat the peer sends if it leaves the group, which explains why leaving \nand rejoining doesn't help - the other peers don't even realise the peer \nleft.\n\nAll this goes for audio too (there's a separate message number for lossy \npackets).\n\nThis may take some thought to fix properly.\n",
