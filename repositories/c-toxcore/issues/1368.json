Clients that use c-toxcore, like all of https://wiki.tox.chat/clients are also open source, as is required by the license of c-toxcore.\r\n\r\n\"Tok Messenger - Lite\" https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.client.tok.gp (probably) uses the library, with their own changes that make it less secure, but their repo at https://github.com/InsightIM/Tok-Android hasn't had a commit in months, despite their latest release on the play store being 3 days ago. This is a license violation, and a security concern for anyone wanting to use the app.\r\n\r\nSome conservation about this before can be found here https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/1319\r\n\r\nI'd recommend against using \"Tok Messenger - Lite\". Their reviews are seemingly all (except for maybe one) fake, they violate the license despite being contacted multiple times, and they added centralized elements to their fork of toxcore that reduces the security of the app.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for an Android client, take a look at:\r\n[aTox](https://github.com/evilcorpltd/aTox) which uses an old version of c-toxcore and is fully open source an actively developed, [TRIfA](https://github.com/zoff99/ToxAndroidRefImpl/) which uses a modified version of c-toxcore that is still open source and is actively maintained, or [Antox](https://github.com/Antox/Antox) which uses an old version of c-toxcore but the app is no longer maintained.",

So yes, Tox clients are opensource, and if there is a client which isn't - it's likely committing a license violation.\r\n\r\nSome of our developers have looked into Tok and it appears like it's violating the license by not providing its users with the up-to-date source code of the application. It has also modified c-toxcore in some questionable ways, e.g. everyone using Tok's version of c-toxcore connects to Tok's bot, so Tok knows IP-to-Tox Id relation of everyone using it. I haven't looked into its code past that, so maybe there is more that it's doing. Other developers (I think it was @zugz?) have looked into Tok more than I, so they would know better. They have also requested Tok to provide the up-to-date source code multiple times, which resulted in nothing. It's really frustrating.\r\n\r\nAnyone knowledgeable about this whole Tok thing willing to write a blog post about it? I have asked this on IRC before, but it didn't get anywhere.",

I'm a mobile software engineer, I don't want to manage my own servers or having any backend. If I'm correct Tox protocol is decentralised and doesn't require having own servers.\n\nI would / might want to develop first-class mobile client, hire for it's design good UI / UX specialists. And provide paid version.\n\nI'm not sure, but I don't see reasons to only have open-source clients (except license requirements). Security / privacy should be encoded in Tox protocol itself to work in untrusted environment. Open source clients doesn't help in that at all. No one will analyze that code for every commit and verify checksums of every update.\n\nNoone never ever open source main business products - neither Google, nor Facebook, Microsoft, Telegram, etc. They open source only partial, core technologies and get benefits for that (extended testing under different conditions and environments, free testing, free bug submitting, and sometimes free contributions).\n\nFor me, to do that professionally, that client would mean \"main\" / core business. And of course and don't want to open source it - noone need another yet abandoned client without support.\n\nWhen it comes to Telegram, could you provide links to their open-sourced backend? Couldn't find it. What they have opened clients doesn't change anything at all in terms of business and control. What's the point to not open source clients in this case?",

So aside from trusting the Tox protocol you also have to trust the client application not to be malicious, which is a lot easier to do if it is open source, as that makes it a lot easier to examine what the client does, and it also allows to build a binary off of the verified source code instead of trusting that the pre-built client used this exact source code, as it could have been built with some unpublished backdoor patches added on top.\r\n",

Open source doesn't mean free as a beer\n\nToo easy to derive work to which I will put all my professional and financial resources. Because it's open-source.\n\nToo easy for someone else to violate GPLv3 license, just not opening derived code.\n\nToo difficult to prove they derived their code from mine's GPLv3 one. Just to force them to show their code (to prove) you need legally sue them. It's very time-consuming and costs a lot.\n\nToo difficult to oblige someone to open it's code when they violated GPLv3. You need some protectors for that like Free Software Foundation and it's lawers help.\n\nAnd multiple cases starting from linux videos drivers code, Cisco, etc. to Chinese companies prove that. Even NVidia didn't open their drivers while they should. They use their own interpretation of the license.",
