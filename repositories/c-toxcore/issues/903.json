Making free software is already hard. Those companies already have an advantage over us and we can hardly compete with them. Free software projects can not afford millions on marketing like them.

Mainly because I don't like it when people do something for free, because they have fun and want to make the world a better place, and then a company makes profit from that free labour without giving back to the original people. The GPL gives us a chance to prevent that. Mostly because the hard and tedious work (library) gets tightly coupled to the thing that makes profit (client).\r\n\r\nI would however have no problem if a company decides to hire someone (hopefully me :P) just to re-implement the Tox protocol with the LGPL or a dual license. Because then my main problem point would not apply, the people who do the work also get benefits.",

Companies who make profit off their proprietary software don't want to lose it and sometimes do what they can to keep people from using alternatives, especially those that are free software and cost nothing. There have been cases where companies tried to hurt open source projects. Microsoft is one of the biggest examples (it's why some users are leaving GitHub). One of GNU's goals is to get rid of proprietary software entirely. So yes, it is a war. I try to not contribute to projects that don't use a copyleft license. There are exceptions where the license needs to be more permissive, but Tox isn't one of them. Unrelated: today I found this interesting article about how Microsoft tried to push everyone into using their insecure Internet Explorer browser http://toastytech.com/evil/ieisevilstory.html.",

            "body": "The position is clear but irrelevant. We could not relicense toxcore if we wanted to, because we don't have the right to do that, and we'd need to ask permission from every contributor. Any one contributor can disagree with their work being licensed under LGPL, which means removing their contribution. All of this is likely impossible, and at the very least extremely time-consuming. I'd rather we focus the time we have on feature implementations and code health improvements than on administrative work that some company may benefit from. Feel free to take on the work of tracking down all the contributors and reverting their work if they don't agree, but I would suggest to any project member not to spend time on this.\r\n\r\nI believe the question is answered, so closing this issue.",
