All packets that are sent every x seconds should depend on this variable in some way (not necessarily in the same way). This should help (mobile) clients restrict/allow the network usage depending on availability of data usage.\r\n\r\nAnd copy of my own comments:\r\n\r\nIs it possible to limit such traffic?\r\nSpecify some rate or similar things.\r\nI think it is too much packets per second for chat.\r\n\r\nApproximately it sends/receives 600 packets per minute per one instance.\r\nMaybe it is possible to install own server and communicate with the world through that server and each node will have the same DHT traffic obtained from such server?\r\n\r\nI think for now my meta traffic is much greater than my payload.\r\nAnd such big traffic will be a problem for mobile devices.\r\n",

It can be some sort of ratio/factor/weight of node... \r\nAlso I suggested another option for networks - dedicated server for DHT.\r\nLet's say you have 100 desktops inside local network... it is much better to have some external node which will handle DHT for whole this group. I prefer to setup VPS and connect tox clients to it. I know it is maybe too much work.. but just as idea for the future.\r\nSo such DHT node will have loading factor 100 of 100 and nodes connected to that node will have 0 of 100 (working as mobile client reporting only about itself). If it is standalone node (for example notebook) this can be set to 10 of 100 (some value calculated experimentally). Otherwise you will have to turn off Wi-Fi or Tox if you are on battery.\r\n\r\nMy knowledge in DHT is not big. But common idea: there is a lot of cases when it can be important to limit participation in DHT.\r\n",
