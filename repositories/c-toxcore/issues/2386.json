To rephrase this, Tox is connected via UDP only if its DHT is connected to a non-LAN, i.e. Internet, node. This is not a bad assumption in the context of trying to connect to the greater DHT that is on the Internet, as perhaps the router NAT is preventing you from establishing UDP connections with Internet nodes, which is why you are only able to connect to LAN nodes. It's reasonable to say that you are not connected to the DHT via UDP in this case. However, if your intent was never to connect to the Internet DHT, if it was to use Tox on LAN instead, then yes, reporting that DHT is not UDP-connected is misleading. It is not UDP-connected to Internet nodes, but is UDP-connected to LAN nodes. I wonder if we need an extra flag in the connection status to indicate LAN/non-LAN connection status? Or at the very least we could clarify the documentation to say something like \"A UDP connection to a non-LAN Internet node has been established.\".\r\n\r\n>also because of this line we would bootstrap endlessly when only connected to LAN nodes?\r\n\r\nAgain, if your intent is to connect to the Internet DHT nodes, then there is nothing wrong with such behavior. But if you intend to use Tox only for LAN, then you wouldn't want this behavior, as you pointed out. I guess Tox wasn't designed with LAN-only use-case in mind.",
