And new users need hand-holding and encouraging to get on - I know because you both did it for me a year or two ago. Plus it shows the world signs of being alive.\r\n\r\nSo I feel a bi-directional gatewayed IRC _is essential_ from the end users perspective. There are IRC alternatives to libera, and I remember one looked good the last time I looked. And the bridging to NGC I found very useful.\r\n\r\nI'm one of those people that expect an IRC help group, and it\r\nhelped me a lot when I was getting started.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is https://www.oftc.net/ I think. Good security and helpful staff.\r\n\r\n(Are you stting down? Weechat is an iRC client, that also offers a local server\r\nyou can use to connect to the client. I have a weechat window in toxygen\r\nso I can weechat IRC in one window and Tox NGC in another. And with bridging, imagine the possibilities :-,)\r\n\r\nPS: there's nothing to install - you don't know python c-types.",
