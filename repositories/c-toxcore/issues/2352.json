    "body": "I have weird networking problems with SOCKS proxies. \r\n\r\nThis is a very rare SEGV caught by gdb running python ```(gdb -ex r --args /usr/bin/python3.9)```. This is an infinite loop leading to a segv under ```toxygen``` when connected to a SOCKS5 proxy (Tor). This happening at a time when toxic on the same machine is completely blocked from Tox chat and NGC. SEGVs are a rare case under toxygen - I've very rarely seen it.\r\n\r\nThe tracebacks are Python running under gdb. toxygen is just wrapping libtoxcore, and any errors in the wrapping are almost always immediately fatal when calling, so I don't suspect toxygen. \r\n\r\nSo the trace is a mixture of:\r\n\r\n1. a recent c-toxcore compiled TRACE - those messages start\r\n```TRAC>```\r\n\r\n2. Python logging, which all looks normal. It starts:\r\n``` modname DEBUG|INFO debugmessage```\r\nor DBUG+ or sometimes no prefix at all - ```[```\r\n\r\n3. gdb traceback at the end\r\n\r\nComments:\r\n\r\n@Green-Sky I'm not someone who knows the code, but I'd say the the code in ```TCP_client.c#950``` is retrying ```proxy_socks5_read_connection_response``` an infinite number of times, and at the very least, as a failsafe, it must give up and fail after a set amount of time or number of tries. There should be no infinite loops.\r\n\r\n@JFreegman Why is net_packet_type_name returning \"unknown\"?\r\nThere's no 0x05 entry in``` typedef enum Net_Packet_Type```.\r\n\r\nTraceback:\r\n\r\nhttps://bin.nixnet.services/?bf35a2c2c484f266#9JRCgpKJ62Rsruu99Fdr4gzYGpZwWVtyncGWYWdWMosc\r\n",

It can't be that hard to do (YMMV :0) and https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/2332 gives a simple reproducible test case, so it that could be done it's a great step. That can be done right away and make help or solve the problem anyway.\r\n\r\nThe TCP code probably doesn't get as much testing/fuzzing as the UDP and it may get attacked, like Tor gets attacked, so it should  be hardened,\r\n\r\n\r\n@nurupo \"did you modify the toxcore you are using in any way? \" no -it's -DDebug and some CMakeLists things turned on but a clean TokTok/c-toxcore checkout of a couple of weeks ago, that have been running toxic and toxygen fine for weeks/months.\r\n\r\nIt's a recent problem - last few days, and the logs always have these  errors:\r\n```\r\n\r\nTRAC> network.c#789:loglogdata [05 = <unknown>           ] T=>   3= 5.79.75.37:33445 (0: OK) | 0000000000000000...00\r\nTRAC> TCP_common.c#203:read_TCP_packet recv buffer has 0 bytes, but requested 2 bytes\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. I checked one of the IPs and it's Tha's and he's certain it's not TEST_NET.\r\n2.  JF sez 05 is a known packet type code for TCP but network.c#789 is telling  me otherwise. So I think this code needs to explicitly drop any 05 packets and log it as such.\r\n3. The log sez ``` 0000000000000000...00``` - does that mean someone it intentionally sending a null or short or zeros packet? Bear in mind that this could be intentionally bad behaviour - \"this might be an attack scenario \". \r\n4. JF sez that 05 packets get dropped by relays, but I disagree and feel these packets came from Tox over Tox from TCP relays - I'm behind a firewall. So could the tcp_server code explicitly drop 05 packets and log it as such.\r\n\r\n@nurupo \" it's actually not toxcore that caused the crash but toxygen\" No I don't think so. I know the stacktrace sez it SEGVed in the logger, but the logger is just print statements and hasn't changed in months. You can't ignore the logger worked fine for the preceding 200 lines of errors! My feeling is, and I've seen this before, the code infinite looped until resource exhaustion or something, which caused the SEGV - the code is spending most of its time in the logger, so it got caught there. I can CNP the logger code but the code is  a CTYPEs wrapping of  a Python callback that allocates no resources.\r\n\r\nWe're very lucky because:\r\n1)  I got a gdb stack trace\r\n2) https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/2332 is reproducible, although perhaps unrelated. Although \"trace output is supposed to spam your log into oblivion\" the logs are indicating problems and SEGVs are a very big problem.\r\n3) \"these are very weird logs\"  :-)\r\n\r\nPS: in writing TCP client or server code remember that \"reasonable\" timeouts may have to be seriously extended when it's over a proxy.",

            "body": "According to that stack trace, it crashes when calling `log_callback` callback function provided by Toxygen:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/0a277b52ea22fe297a8487ac05a0c507a74c6480/toxcore/tox.c#L78\r\n\r\nEither the `log_callback` function pointer, as provided by Toxygen to toxcore, is invalid, or it crashes somewhere inside that function. Either way, the crash is caused by Toxygen.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for the `read_TCP_packet recv buffer has 0 bytes, but requested 10 bytes` log spam: toxcore sends a SOCKS5 proxy an authentication request (for no authentication), the proxy replies that it accepted the request, then toxcore sends the connection request and the proxy just doesn't reply anything back. According to your logs, it looks like toxcore keeps waiting for the proxy to reply to the connection request, never receiving the reply, so it keeps checking for a reply for the full remainder of the 10 second TCP connection timeout.\r\n\r\n@emdee-is \r\n\r\n>When I see 200 lines like\r\n>\r\n>>TRAC> TCP_common.c#203:read_TCP_packet recv buffer has 0 bytes, but requested 10 bytes\r\n>\r\n>doesn't that mean something is retrying too hard and should have failed?\r\n\r\nNo it doesn't. The reason why you are seeing so many of such messages is because there are A LOT of SOCKS5 connections going on, and toxcore keeps checking all of them for the data on every iteration, until the TCP connection is timed out, which is 10 seconds. It's not an infinite loop in the regular sense of a hot `while 1` loop, it just checks if the proxy replied every tox iteration, without blocking anything else toxcore might be doing, unlike what a hot loop would do. Everything is working as intended.\r\n\r\n@Green-Sky\r\n\r\n>The tcp code right now does not timeout established connections, that don't receive data. The same happens on tcp_relays.\r\n\r\nYes it does time out. As mentioned on IRC, TCP client has a clear timeout: if it doesn't establish a connection in 10 seconds -- the connection gets closed:\r\n\r\n- [It's set to 10 seconds here](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/19b9cf3812a21548893a7e4fe6f2758948c7690a/toxcore/TCP_client.c#L648)\r\n- [It's checked on every iteration in here](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/19b9cf3812a21548893a7e4fe6f2758948c7690a/toxcore/TCP_client.c#L989)\r\n- [And the connection gets closed in the layer above -- tcp connections](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/master/toxcore/TCP_connection.c#L1624)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow to the weird stuff going on in the log.\r\n\r\nA SOCKS5 negotiation goes like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Tox => Proxy: 05 01 00                   # hey, SOCKS5 proxy, i want to connect using the no-auth method\r\n2. Proxy => Tox: 05 00                      # ok, go ahead, i support no-auth\r\n3. Tox => Proxy: 05 01 00 01 <IPv4> <PORT>  # cool, connect me to IP:PORT please\r\n4. Proxy => Tox: 05 00 00 01 <IPv4> <PORT>  # there you go, I have connected to it with my IP:PORT, whatever you send next will be proxied now\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this look familiar? For example, take a look at the TCP communication with the `85.143.221.42:33445` node from your log:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. TRAC> network.c#789:loglogdata [05 = <unknown>           ] T=>   3= 85.143.221.42:33445 (0: OK) | 0000000000000000...00\r\n2. TRAC> network.c#789:loglogdata [05 = <unknown>           ] =>T   2= 85.143.221.42:33445 (0: OK) | 0000000000000000...00\r\n3. TRAC> network.c#789:loglogdata [05 = <unknown>           ] T=>  10= 85.143.221.42:33445 (0: OK) | 010001558fdd2a82...a5\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst toxcore sends 3 bytes of `05 00 00`, then receives `05 00`, then sends `05 01 00 01  558fdd2a82 82a5`. `558fdd2a82` is 85.143.221.42, `82a5` is 33445.\r\n\r\nNote that the first message is logged as `05 00 00` when it is in fact `05 01 00` that is being sent. That's because it's less than 5 bytes long. If a packet is less than 5 bytes, it's logged as zeros instead of actual value in the packet (kind of weird, but it looks like the code expects to see two 4-byte integers in there instead of the SOCKS5 protocol data, and in that context it makes sense. perhaps logging needs to account for the cases like this too?):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/8054854b583c4c11c7ceafae4ab2e0e0150c8115/toxcore/network.c#L636-L645\r\n\r\nNote that (2) is similarly logged as zeros, however because toxcore replies with (3), we can deduct that the node has in fact sent us `05 00`, as otherwise toxcore wouldn't send (3) to it.\r\n\r\nAlso note that step 4 of SOCKS5 negotiation is missing, the node never replies back, which is the cause of what @emdee-is called an \"infinite loop\" -- toxcore is checking on the connection request reply from the proxy, with `read_TCP_packet recv buffer has 0 bytes, but requested 10 bytes` being printed into logs.\r\n\r\n~~Anyway, to cut it with \"Note ...\", it looks like your toxcore is trying to connect to multiple DHT nodes using the said DHT nodes as SOCKS5 proxies. This should not be happening. It should be trying to connect to multiple DHT nodes using the user-provided SOCKS5 proxy, it should NOT be using the DHT nodes it's trying to connect to as SOCKS5 proxies. Also, it's weird that the nodes reply back with `05 00` as if they actually have a SOCKS5 proxy server running. Obviously it's something in toxcore that is replying, because `85.143.221.42:33445` is no SOCKS5 proxy address, that's toxcore, but why it replies back and why with the correct SOCKS5 server reply? The server reply is not even implemented in toxcore, toxcore doesn't implement SOCKS5 proxy server functionality, only the client functionality. Also why is all this happening inside of `do_gc_tcp()` call? Is this a NGC bug? Sounds like a NGC bug. Somehow `TCP_Proxy_Info.ip_port` that is being passed into `new_TCP_connection()` contains the ip_port of a DHT node instead of a proxy. I don't see how Toxygen could cause that since `Tox_Options` allows to specify only 1 proxy but according to your logs toxcore uses many different ones. @emdee-is Did you perhaps modify your toxcore? If not, @JFreegman should take a look at the ip_port used [in init_gc_tcp_connection()](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/7dfa935ac8f1c176d9b14c52064a9c9191137981/toxcore/group_chats.c#L7226) and how could it be that of a different DHT node every time it's called.~~\r\n\r\nSo a list of issues discovered:\r\n\r\n- Toxygen does something that cases the crash during the log callback.\r\n- Toxcore packet logging assumes that the 1st byte is the packet type followed by two 4-byte integers in network-byte order. This is obviously not the case when toxcore communicates with SOCKS5 and HTTP proxies, because proxy servers don't use the Tox protocol, they use SOCKS5 and HTTP protocols, and those protocols don't start the packet with a Tox packet id followed by two integers. Perhaps unknown packet types need to be logged as is? Or we should somehow signify to the logger that these are not Tox protocol packets so that it logs them differently?\r\n- ~Toxcore replies to a SOCKS5 client authentication negotiation request with the correct SOCKS5 server reply. Would be nice if it didn't do that.~\r\n- ~A bug (in NGC?) with the wrong proxy ip port being passed when creating TCP_client connections.~",

The `85.143.221.42:33445` that is printed in logs is [the address that the TCP connection should \\*eventually\\* communicate with](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/blob/19b9cf3812a21548893a7e4fe6f2758948c7690a/toxcore/TCP_client.c#L619), not necessarily the current address it's communicating with if it's using a proxy. Wish the logs would made that clear. So there is no bug in NGC and toxcore doesn't try to connect to DHT nodes as SOCKS5 proxies, it's just the logs that make it appear like that's what is happening. This also explains why we are getting the perfect SOCKS5 server reply back, because we are, in fact, communicating with a SOCKS5 proxy, not toxcore.\r\n\r\nI have edited my last comment, crossing out the mistaken parts.

I've rarely/never had SEGVs with toxcore under toxygen, and I've almost never seen these network errors before, even though I have gotten all toxcore TRACE info for months. \r\n2. toxygen has been stable with NGC for years from the libcore perspective. Lots of little UI issues, but it's the only desktop client with NGC.\r\n3. Toxygen makes one Tox instance from one Tox_options instance, so the SOCKS info is set only once.\r\n4. I and others have noticed that NGC connects better and faster than connecting chat to its members (me always over SOCKS). In fact I can be in a state where I can /whisper to someone in the NGC group when I can't connect with them in chat, which always amazes me.\r\n5. Ideally we would have a SOCKS_TRACE analogue to LOGGER_TRACE that looked up the right SOCKS 5 protocol Type, so that the TRACES are meaningful for SOCKS usage. Otherwise people will end up saying: \"these logs confused me so much\".\r\n",

I wonder why. It should reply back with success/failure at least. It could be that with the Tor proxy being Tor, it is taking a long time to establish a connection to the destination IP:port, and Toxygen crashed before Tor managed to established it and reply back to toxcore with the success/failure. Or perhaps it took Tor over 10 seconds to do so, at which point toxcore timedout and closed the SOCKS5 connection.",

Again I don't suspect the logger because 1) it's just print() statements, and 2) it's printed hundreds of lines by the time we get here. So my feeling is that the SOCKS code is not robust enough to handle these pathalogical cases, or these cases are unusual for the proxy. \r\n\r\nThere are warnings in the Tor log that the network is having problems:\r\n```\r\nGuard kik*** is failing a very large amount of circuits. Most likely this means the Tor network is overloaded, but it could also mean an attack against you or potentially the guard itself. Success counts are ...\r\n```\r\nThe warnings are not that uncommon, but like it says, it could be an attack. There's nothing like it in the rest of my normal web usage with HTTP/POP...\r\n\r\nI don't want to beat a dead horse, and I *really* don't want to waste your time, but 3 crashes in 3 days is unheard of  - I haven't had one in months  - and it is possible Tox over Tor is targeted. Similar logs of short reads. Although JF, as you reminded me,  LOG_TRACE is supposed to generate tonnes of logging, and nurupo you read them as being \"normal\", this is actually not the case for me - I've rarely seen the logger say anything, although it's been wired up for a couple of months. So I think there is a real problem.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help and I'll put the logs for these 2 up tomorrow.\r\n",

There's crap in there like dead and duplicated nodes in the DHT section https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/2347 https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/2343 but these SEGVs happen long after startup and always during bootstrap. By guess is someone has found a way of using guard or exit nodes to be malicious and it affects the DHT and not NGC - remember when I could /whisper to you but not chat with you?\r\n\r\nBear in mind that Tox over Tor is a whole different ballgame than Tox over UDP, and is only lightly tested: not at all really - just simple SOCKS.

You will have to recompile toxcore with it enabled. seems the toxcore cmake is mising an option for this, so you will have to add a `link_libraries(-fsanitize=address)` anywhere in the cmake to force it to link with it.\r\nAdditionally, since its a library and the host process needs to be hooked, you will need to preload libasan into python or something.\r\n`LD_PRELOAD=/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so.5 python stuff.py` or similar on my machine.\r\n\r\nedit: asan will tell you the place allocations happen, accessviolations doublefrees, (exclusive!!) use-after-frees etc",
