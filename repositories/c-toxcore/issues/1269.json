It doesn't even try to send the \nmessage, because there's no-one to send it to. It is a bit strange not \nto distinguish in the error code between this case and an actual failed \nattempt to send a message. Maybe we should we make it -5, and then the \nclient can print a nice error message explaining that there's no-one in \nthe group?\n\n>I added in a the conference connected callback and it never gets \n>triggered, I tried creating a new groupchat it also never triggers the \n>connected callback.\n\nThat's correct behaviour. That callback is triggered only after an \naccepted invitation.\n",
