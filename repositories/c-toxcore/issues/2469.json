I don't think that is a test of whether the program connected to the network and the proxy works.\r\n\r\nIn real life I find that tox_add_tcp_relay always returns true, even if the SOCKS proxy is not connected to the internet (wifi down). My toxygen code randomly picks 6 BS nodes and tox_add_tcp_relay them all, and then checks dht_connected, repeated every 5? seconds for up to 120? seconds. It's very rare to get the dht_connected in less than 30 seconds, more normal would be 45.\r\n\r\nCheck what tox_add_tcp_relay and if it ever fails, but AFAIK this is a test of minimal use. The testing case over SOCKS gets harder for things like group_join; there on a fresh group, it's more like 45 minutes, and more likely to have a code failure than tox_add_tcp_relay as it changes often.",

I don't think that is a test of whether the program connected to the network and the proxy works.\r\n\r\nLooking at the code to tox_add_tcp_relay in tox.c, as long as the relay host resolves, it doesn't even look for failure from add_tcp_relay: \r\n```\r\n        add_tcp_relay(tox->m->net_crypto, &root[i], public_key);\r\n```\r\nwhich is what I see in practice.\r\n\r\nIn the testsuite case it will never fail because the nodes it tests against are on localhost, which will always resolve. In other words, Tox's test of a tcp SOCKS proxy will always pass.\r\n\r\nPS: Dear Santa: A version of add_tcp_relay that loops through a set of tcp nodes and loops until dht_connected is true is very high on my wish list.",

It has to fail: it starts a socks proxy written in go that is behind a firewall with no information on the outside-of-ctesrt proxy IP:port. So there is no testing of a proxy in Tox that's firewalled - at all.~~ Note that Tox does not yet support corporate proxies https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/issues/1682  \r\n\r\nThere's a blindspot in the project by relying on ctest. If the project supported Python bindings https://github.com/TokTok/py-toxcore-c/issues/78#issuecomment-1920417914  then it would be easier to use a proxy-aware testrunner written in Python: https://git.plastiras.org/emdee/toxygen_wrapper/src/branch/main/src/tox_wrapper/tests/tests_wrapper.py",

All the other ctests ate not testing real network-connected behaviour.\r\nTo confirm, turn off your wifi and run ctest, So the idea behind this feature request is to think deal with the missing coverage of those 2 ctests.  \r\n\r\nI personally think that all the testing should be expanded as well so that real across-the-network testing is done in real world conditions. But  that's better done in Python. If TokTok supported Python it could do a [proxy-aware testrunner](https://git.plastiras.org/emdee/toxygen_wrapper/src/branch/main/src/tox_wrapper/tests/tests_wrapper.py).
