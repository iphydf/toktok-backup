There are build scripts for them [here](https://github.com/evilcorpltd/aTox/tree/master/scripts) which publish the Tox dependencies as regular maven packages to a local repository, then you can just [depend on them](https://github.com/evilcorpltd/aTox/blob/96de8d882a5495690c68d56879cd8a748df3fb0b/domain/build.gradle.kts#L103-L104) in Gradle the normal way.\r\n\r\nIf you want to write your own jni wrapper, I started doing that [here](https://github.com/robinlinden/tox4k/tree/master/tox4k), including building c-toxcore from Gradle and all that stuff.\r\n\r\nEdit: The build scripts I linked to you'll have to run from Linux (or WSL!), but after that's done you can use the artifacts in Windows too. I packaged the artifacts up at https://robinli.eu/f/tox4j-prebuilt.7z for someone that was having issues building tox4j, but I recommend you build them yourself. The jni-wrapper project (tox4k) I linked to builds in both Linux and Windows.",
