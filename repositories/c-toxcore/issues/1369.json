    "body": "# Motivation\r\nI'm currently doing some experiments with making ToxAV compatible with the standard RTP/WebRTC stack.\r\nFrom my impression, Tox initially followed this path (encapsulating RTP in Tox), as evidenced by the naming and header fields of `RTPMessage`, but then diverged and invented custom solutions for standard problems (for example: Inventing a \"Large Frame\" protocol with the `data_length` and `offset` fields instead of RFC 7741 VP8 Payloading).\r\n\r\nThe \"batteries-included\" approach of ToxAV, meaning that library users only deal with uncompressed buffers, makes it easy to build an AV-enabled Tox client and shields the application programmer from the nitty gritty details of video streaming, but also makes some features, like hardware accelerated video decoding with zero-copy display impossible.\r\n\r\nAs a result, Tox now maintains an inadequate, incompatible implementation of an AV streaming stack, an entirely out-of-scope endeavour for a project this size.\r\nIMHO, Tox should redefine it's role as being a distributed, secure transport layer for a standards compliant RTP implementation.\r\nIn the future, TokTok might still provide a basic AV implementation, but focus on application-layer compatibility, and avoid sinking developer time in developing isolated solutions for problems that have already been solved by a multitude of other projects.\r\n\r\nBesides the benefits of using existing implementations, a RTP-compliant ToxAV would enable many other applications, like bridging to WebRTC peers, video-on-demand delivery and more.\r\n\r\n# Migration Path\r\n\r\nSince legacy compatibility is an important requirement for Tox, replacing the protocol overnight isn't an option. A migration path could look like this:\r\n\r\n1) Carving out the specification of current/\"legacy\" ToxAV protocol\r\n2) Write adapter code to convert ToxAV->RTP / RTP->ToxAV\r\n3) Use those converters within Toxcore, to convert packets between legacy peers and the new RTP based implementation\r\n\r\nThe feasability of 2) is currently researched/demonstrated within github.com/strfry/gotox\r\n\r\n# API Changes\r\n\r\n## Signalling\r\n\r\nSignalling commands (Call, Answer, Hangup, etc.) are currently sent on a special comm channel, and internally handled by `msi.c`, where a callback-style interface is provided.\r\nThis seemed like a good spot to hook on, since it's exactly what `toxav_new` does, which i intend to replace.\r\nIn my prototype, i just expose this internal API by means of the FFI ( https://github.com/TokTok/go-toxcore-c/compare/master...strfry:feature/msi ), so no direct action is needed, but i think it is debatable whether the API described in `msi.h` would be a good cutting point for a public API.\r\n\r\n## Packet ID filtering\r\n\r\nThe `lossy_packet` interface basically enables us to send and receive AV packets.\r\nOnly problem, it explicitly checks for AV related packet IDs, to multiplex between ToxAV and userspace.\r\nThis just affects a few lines, that need to handle this condition in a different way: https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/compare/master...strfry:feature/pluggable_rtp\r\nOf course statically disabling the ToxAV codepath isn't an option because it would break existing AV clients. Another option would be to disable these checks when tox is built without AV support, but this isn't an ideal solution other.\r\n\r\nMaybe this could be dependend on the previous allocation of a ToxAV object?\r\nI'm not sure if there would be unexpected side-effects for existing ToxAV-clients, that might get confused by video packets coming in through the custom_lossy_packet interface?\r\n\r\n# Open Issues\r\n\r\nThe (Web)RTC stack uses the Session Description Protocol (SDP, RFC4566) to negotiate various details, such as codecs, protocol extension and ICE connection candidates. \r\nSDP is a common point of criticism of the WebRTC spec, and was mostly accepted for easier compatibility with existing SIP networks.\r\nIt's complexity, and integral support for features that are not necessary in the context of ToxAV make it unfavorable for inclusion in Tox.\r\nIt is yet to be researched how the necessary options can be mapped to Tox capabilities, and how much can be skipped through higher base specifications within Tox. For example, we can assume support for the Opus audio codec, and don't need to negotiate about things like \"PCMU/8000\".\r\n\r\nAnother topic of research is mapping the various RTCP commands to existing comm channel commands for bandwidth regulation.\r\n",

            "body": "#### Motivation\r\n\r\nI generally agree with your motivation, ToxAV tries to re-invent the wheel in several places and has numerous issues. Therefore it should be replaced rather sooner than later.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Migration path\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if you know about this project: https://github.com/toxext/toxext/\r\n\r\nRight now it's only the basis for a PoC of a new messaging format, but it might save you some headaches when trying to keep backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nI'd propose to implement whatever idea you have in mind with this as an extension and once it's sufficiently widespread remove the original ToxAV.\r\n\r\n #### Open Issues\r\n\r\n> It's complexity, and integral support for features that are not necessary in the context of ToxAV make it unfavorable for inclusion in Tox.\r\n\r\nI agree here and I want to add some more reasons why such a protocol might be bad.\r\nIMO the beauty of ToxAV at the moment is that it's only one supported video codec that is patent free and can be used anywhere. No complexity needed in selecting anything. Additionally I don't want to step into the minefield that is h264 or h265. I would be ok though if VPx was required to be supported and e.g. h264 optional.\r\n\r\nSome more things you might want to think about:\r\n- Co-existence with large file transfers\r\n- Threading, currently all encoding/decoding is done in one thread. This doesn't scale with higher resolutions or multiple parallel calls or groups. Ideally we'd use as many threads as possible, with a run-time setable limit by the client\r\n",
