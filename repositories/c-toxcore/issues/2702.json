If they need access to the structure, then it should be considered in the ABI. Even if you want to make the structure private, you can't ignore the fact that the project has been adding getters and setters to the ABI with no discussion or ABIbreak tagging  or version bump, and has turned long supported functionality into an optional feature without warning or version bump. That's doesn't conform to semantic versioning.\r\n\r\nIf the project followed semantic versioning and pushed minor releases for all these changes, the project would have more releases as they get merged in, which is a Good Thing. I doubt the project eill do the planning required for semantic versioning as things are \"or not even not being discussed at all but being in developers' heads and then dropping as a surprise fully implemented PR, [which] is not very good.\"\r\n\r\nThe only way of doing something like a good wrapper into Python is if c-toxcore keeps up-to-date one of the existing ctypes wrappers, or uses the standard wrapper generator ctypesgen. I think the project should include a generated wrapper as a part of c-toxcore releases so that the code is always matched to the Ccode. (ctypesgen has no dependencies relying only on Python, and wraps c-toxcore in about a minute.)  Many good projects ship the Python bindings with the C code (e.g. zmq).\r\n\r\nAll development in Python has been frozen for more than 2 years, and yet there's been no need for any tools other than ctypesgen, which is widely used and continually developed by some of the core Python developers, including the BDfL. The use of home-brewed tools written in a language not available, or explicitly banned, in corporate enviornments, that generates debugger-unfriendly code, is counter-productive. \r\n",

C-toxcore has an independent java wrapping which I assume everyone is happy with and that there are no plans to move these bindings to a one-size-fits-all approach.\r\n\r\nThe Python bindings were working in C and the bindings stopped working in anticipation of a home-brewed scheme that had almost no coverage, which ended all development in Python on the project. That's bad because there were excellent and easily maintainable Ctypes bindings that could have been adopted by the project instead, and Python had one of the best, and only NGC, desktop clients. That situation persists to this day.\r\n\r\nThe homebrew bindings generate Cython, which is not a good technology to use for this compared to ctypes, and I can find no trace of a discussion where the reasons for using Cython were ever justified. I can see no reason not to end that approach now and adopt the mature ctypes wrapping that exist today. There's more to doing a wrapping than just the bindings, and Python is a moving target because of typing so ctypesgen would help as the language evolves. You can do a homebrew solution that gives a poor result noone wants to use: for example if it does not easily support debugging across the Python/C interface - think SWIG. So I would argue against a one-size-fits-all approach at least for Python (and I assume Java).\r\n\r\nAfter Java and Python there may be merit in a one-size-fits-all  but that there maybe better approaches that writing you own tool in a language almost nobody knows or has or uses. Look at the way ctypesgen covers generating Lua bindings as a example.",

The project does no semantic versioning  to allow the users of the ABI to know what's in there; just big releases years apart.\r\n\r\nIn addition new fields/setters/getters are added with no warning and no semantic versioning on changes that strongly impact existing features, sometimes negatively.\r\n\r\nI doubt this will change which is why I argue for including the Python wrappers in the release and automatically keeping them up to date with the code.

And when the hs-genapi works for python the Cython layer need to be wrapped in a friendlier Python layer (already done for ctypes).  And when the friendlier Python layer is done, there'll still need to be a comprehesive testsuite written with good coverage (already well underway for ctypes) https://github.com/TokTok/py-toxcore-c/issues/79.  So at this rate the hs-apigen Python route, with tests, means years more of dead development.\r\n\r\nAnd I suspect, having used SWIG, C, Cython and ctypes wrappings in Python, the Cython wrapping may not be well received. Look at the evolution of ctypesgen with Python \r\nto see what the issues are, and the lack of distro provided gdb-python support that ctypes has is a significant drawback of a Cython route. (I know nothing about Rust but suspect a Rust community-supported generator may be the way to go there too.)\r\n\r\n> So you have to tamper your expectations and not compare us to such juggernauts as the Python project.\r\n\r\nI know, but that makes planning and prioritization all the more important: generating the bindings with a home-brewed program written in a language almost nobody uses, for which there is almost no depth of expertise the project, that is non-existent in corporate settings, in a completely undocumented side-project (not even a comment), while all other development is stopped - I can't find where rationale for that is made.\r\n\r\nLet's get Python bindings working in the core as a priority now, and get the integration testsuite finished so it can be ported to start comprehensively testing the existing wrappings: node, js, kotlin, go, etc. There's lots of changes in the upcoming release that there is no testing of those existing bindings.\r\n\r\nPS: FWIW ctypesgen can also generate a language neutral json file which has been used for generating Lua bindings. It might be a better starting point than a homebrew program as it will be maintained and kept up to date by the Python community.",

They did the best desktop client tox has ever had, which did NGC groups >6 years ago https://github.com/toxygen-project/toxygen/tree/next_gen . They had the best integration suite testing, which can be used for Tor testing, 6 years ago https://github.com/TokTok/py-toxcore-c/issues/79#issue-1384792614 and AFAIK no other binding has that level of testing. One of their C binding was a branch of  py-toxcore-c: https://github.com/TokTok/py-toxcore-c/tree/v0.2.0 One of them igave me the feeling that the project management was a part of why he dropped further work.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to be a python developer to recognize that taking an existing working binding for a language with a test suite, and replacing it with a homebrew in another language that has no coverage for over 2 years is not the way to have or support Python developers. None of them would have requested that.\r\n\r\n> > there'll still need to be a comprehesive testsuite written with good coverage\r\n \r\n> iphydf has made good progress on that (:\r\n\r\nNot that I know of in Cython or any other of the bindings I looked at. Nothing like what was in Python 6 years ago (see above).\r\n\r\n> there will never be binding \"in the core\", but as separate repositories. Again, they all need to be generated, to keep the cost of maintenance as low as possible and keep releases in lockstup with c-toxcore (if need be).\r\n\r\nThe cost of maintenance of py-tox-c is as low as possible as it has been static with no coverage for over 2 years.  The cost of hs-apigen greatly exceeds the cost of adopting an existing ctypes binding, and that's not addressing the other parts I mentioned above that still need doing. And right now, it looks like it is only targeted on Cython, where it's needed least, and presumably each new targeting will also take years at this rate. But I admit the cost of maintenance might be low because no one else programs in Haskell. But the cost of doing homebrew in Haskell has been no support for Python, no funtional testing of the bindings, and will mean divorcing the project from the steady improvements that go into cypesgen.\r\n",
