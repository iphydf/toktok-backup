You must have tcp_relays accessible over Tor if the network wants any resilience against blocking/tampering with the few known seed hosts. And I can't test without Tox responding to tcp ping packets.\r\n\r\nI can see gui clients like toxygen optionally offering a user to setup Tor with every client invocation, so every client runs a Tor access point to the tcp_relays. (In addition to getting some of the stable nodes to do the same.) A tor client is lightweight and adds a lot to resiliency.\r\n",
