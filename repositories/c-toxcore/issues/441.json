Not to mention the traffic it continuously causes when connected to a 3G/4G mobile internet network.

I would be really sad about this. I don't think it's a good idea not to care about the resource consumption toxcore causes in all clients based on it. We'll end up with something like the so-called \"modern web\". Like the Facebook website which is the most bloated interface ever.\r\n\r\nHowever it could be different.\r\n\r\nThey're just some main concepts that should be changed. This is an architerctural decision. There are users that can relay a lot of traffic, e.g. desktop computers with a 10Mbit/100Mbit internet connection. Call them supernodes. All desktop clients should have an option to relay the traffic or not and it should be enabled by default. It should have three states **Enabled / Disabled / Auto**. Auto should be the default. When it's active, Toxcore should do measurements and compute some statistics for itself of network delay, ping and throughput, and CPU usage (!). If the network performance is constantly low or CPU usage caused by Toxcore is high, it should give up the onion style routing for some hours or days. On mobile devices these should be disabled completely.\r\n\r\nFriend announcement should be asynchronous. So if I connect via a client that has relaying disabled, it announces me to one of the bootstrap nodes. The bootstrap nodes introduce me to the DHT network so the supernodes can announce me to other relay-disabled clients.\r\n\r\nWhen I open a chat window with someone toxcore should establish **a P2P connection** to the friend. UPnP must have a high priority for implementation. It's supported by millions of devices and P2P connections could spare most of the traffic for the relay nodes.\r\n\r\nAvatars and any meta information (like status messages) should not be sent unless there is any communication. Or there should be a logic like the **avatar and the status message should be timestamped** and be sent just once a friend comes online. So it should be a local hash table with timestamps paired with friend IDs. Timestamps represent the time a friend successfully received my avatar and stauts message. If the timestamp of the avatar doesn't represent a time later than my avatar was changed, **nothing should be sent to that friend**.\r\n\r\nTox needs serious optimizations like above or it will be the same bloated messenger like all other cloud applications (like Facebook's Messenger) or java-based torrent clients. I don't want to see this happen.",

However, on slower networks, older computers and mobile devices it has more disadvantages than ever. Mobile networks still have high-latency characteristics in many countries, even in the modern part of the world. Let alone the data plans which I do not want to donate because it costs me extra money. Even if the phone batteries lasted for 30 days with one charge, it would be a very bad idea to relay traffic via mobile devices. This is why it should be changed.\r\n\r\nRelaying should be enabled by default in desktop clients and **disabled** by default in mobile clients. And of course there could be and **Auto** option with tradeoffs like _Antox could detect if the device is charging and it's on a fast WiFi network, so it can turn it on automatically_.\r\n\r\nI'm really sorry for the people who live in a police state, but I would rather sacrifice my desktop bandwidth to relay their traffic than my mobile bandwidth.

If you don't make it optional, a **lot of network traffic will be wasted** by Tox users just because of the **idealism** of rerouting all connections that should not be rerouted in 99% of the cases.\r\n\r\nIf you don't make it optional, each mobile user with data plan will waste several hundreds of dollars annually just to keep following this relaying idealism.\r\n\r\nSo guess what, Tox will not be so popular in the mobile era, thus it will not be popular at all in a world where everyone has a smartphone. Furthermore, it will deserve not to be popular if this is because of the narrow-sighted idealism of developers.\r\n\r\nWe are talking about two problems here.\r\n\r\n1. Tox relays all traffic into an onion in order to hide the identity of its users. In 99% of the cases this should not be necessary. This will only be necessary if you live in a police state where secret service comes after you just because of the fact that you communicate with someone on the Tox network or lock you up without a warrant for the same reason. In western world, like the USA or the EU this is not the situation. **Pure P2P connections should be allowed and even made default.** It will take a huge amount of load off the onion and leave it for people who really need it. For these reasons, Tox would have to be redesigned, using the distributed network only for finding each other, and using the onion only when specified.\r\n\r\n2. Tox makes it compulsory to participate in traffic relaying, regardless of the bandwidth and other technical limits of the network connection used. In the long term this will make the network very unreliable as well as making mobile users with data plans waste a lot of money for relaying the traffic. **Traffic relaying should be made optional.**\r\n",
