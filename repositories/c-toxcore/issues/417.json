    "body": "TL;DR, toxcore should be writing more code for our major issues/features faster.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**With respect to major end goals only** In talking with core, and client, developers/admins. I think the pace of development on toxcore should be much faster than it currently is. I'd like to propose a new format. We have enough developers, who care about the project as a whole more than individual features, that if were were to focus all of this time/work, into a unified issue/feature Toxcore would be moving at a runners pace, instead of a snails pace.\r\n\r\n## The problem\r\nWith our current weekly release cycle, the majority of the time spent by code developers is on the low hanging fruit that'll easily be ready within the release cycle window. This is causing the chilling effect of projects better suited to >1 developer writing code go neglected. (These would be the important ones.)\r\n\r\n## The Solution\r\n1.  **Toxcore should stop shipping versions on a consistent release cycle. Instead, toxcore should be shipping features**. These two aren't mutually exclusive, there's no reason patches and fixes shouldn't be merged when ready, but the overhead of drafting weekly releases as a priority should be reduced to, as needed, with the primary focus on getting an important feature or a bugfix ready as quickly as possible. \r\n2.  **Toxcore needs to pick it's next feature/issue of a defined magnitude/scope, and all of the attention of the main developers should be on writing code for that feature and/or section.** This means that [developer] needs to be in charge of selecting an outstanding issue of a reasonable scope with a definitive solution, and easily completable tasks (>= number of developers), then assign tasks to any developer. (Note: The review requirements toxcore uses shouldn't change, this means we need to ensure that while any number of developers may work on a file or function, we need to have enough to make sure that the code is reviewed by someone who hasn't directly touched the code to be reviewed.) The intent of keeping focus on a feature being, that the vast majority of the work done by primary contributors should be on THIS feature/issue, aiming for completing it **correctly** in rapid cycle.\r\n3.  **Where applicable, these features should maintain the important goal of a provable (meaning well tested) system.** Every logic or functional change we make should include a non-fragile test that proves the final changes match the goal. [Optionally, the goal should not be; \"avoid break existing implementation\". But instead should be \"Complete, and test the implementation that offers the best solution\"]\r\n4.  [Optional] We need to implement a staging branch for these features on the main toktok/c-toxcore repo and encourage anyone who want's to help with the functions to push quality commits the branch so that iteration can happen quickly, with support for other developers.\r\n\r\nNone of these suggestions are set in stone, the above are just breadth first suggestion that I hope will get toxcore working together on the important features. All comments, suggestions, and criticisms welcome.",

I'm willing to handle that (if you want me to), and I think I have a\r\nreasonable outline for the job:\r\n\r\n- Outstanding issues (including feature requests) need to be prioritized.\r\n- Based on issue priority, tasks need to be delegated to the appropriate devs.\r\n- Work commences; when development lags, the PM needs to prod people to figure\r\n  out what's blocking progress, and to react accordingly by re-assigning\r\n  tasks, collecting information, delegating new tasks, etc.\r\n- When the work on a task is complete, the PM should assign a \"final review\"\r\n  according to whatever review policy we agree upon.\r\n    - A \"final review\" should probably be an in-depth review, with every\r\n      line checked for style, logic errors, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bottom-line is to remove the cognitive effort involved in management tasks\r\nfrom developers who should be spending it on writing code instead.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are probably some more things that would improve this outline.\r\nAny comments, suggestions, submissions, deletions, omissions, death threats, etc.?\r\n",

It is well suited for feature development, which is currently still very hard to do with confidence on TokTok/c-toxcore.\r\n\r\nThe current workflow was designed to facilitate stabilisation and improvement of the code base, which I have always considered a prerequisite to feature development. However, as I suggested in my initial project plan, there should be a feature development fork (at the time I designated grayhatter/toxcore) in which there is more freedom for experimentation. That is useful for trying new ideas and integrating different ideas into a single branch while still allowing the TokTok/c-toxcore (at the time /toxcore) to keep its slow pace.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Slow development pace and many small iterative releases on TokTok/c-toxcore is by [design](https://toktok.github.io/plan) (note that the concrete steps of the original plan are outdated, but the process still seems appropriate - we're sort of in phase 2).",

Reasons for not adding branches in TokTok/c-toxcore:\r\n- I would like grayhatter to manage experimental feature development completely autonomously. I need not have a hand in that.\r\n- It will not just be one branch. Even with the noble goal of \"everybody works on a single feature\", you will end up having multiple features being worked on at the same time, because serialisation like that simply doesn't work in a small geographically diverse open source project.\r\n- A repository is an organisational unit. You can have different processes (e.g. a different review workflow) per repo. It's not obvious to me whether a rapid feature development branch should have the same workflows as a stable \"slowly clean up and gather knowledge\" branch.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other reasons, but these are the main ones.",

I think a branch won't be enough to setup all the different tools we use to different policies. This repo then could have various branches for everything or maintain the feature code in PRs.\r\n\r\nAs for the features, I know there's code floating around for the new groupchat's and some other stuff, but I can't really find a place with a list of what's WIP and where specs or ideas exist. One can gain that knowledge only by listening on the IRC or actively looking for specific stuff. I think a central place where ideas/WIP stuff can be discussed outside the main repo will help, because I'm certainly not the only one always following the IRC closely.",

So in the end you ideally get some finished work blocks instead of \"lots of random tasks all over the place\", you can then still decide if you release at the end of a sprint or if your releases consist of several sprints and so on.

Given that it is a spare time project, it's acceptable that we skip a release sometimes if we haven't had time to produce anything interesting that week.\r\n\r\nWhat I did so far was assigning issues to milestones as a form of sprints. Creating a release has low overhead (a few person-minutes per week) but allows earlier identification of issues. It sets clear points in time, and if we find an issue with a particular release, we can mark exactly that release as bad and don't need to mark a large range of commits as bad.\r\n\r\nThe change I've made now is that instead of defining sprints ahead of time, I've only defined the current one and the plan is to sit together and decide on what we'll do for the next sprint after building the release for the current one. That would happen tomorrow.\r\n\r\nMaking very long sprints is not a good thing to do, in my opinion, because it's harder to focus on larger tasks. I think our velocity is higher if we split up a task into manageable pieces that can be done in a week's time.",
