Message sizes are all 113 (probably DHT traffic). UDP ports are also the same, 33445. This makes Tox traffic easily identifiable, and therefore blockable by rogue authority bodies.\r\n\r\nHere is how it should be: every peer has its private and public key. Peer IP is distributed along with its public key. Every message sent to it, including DHT messages, is randomly oversized, and encrypted with the destination peer's public key. Small message sizes should be random within some size range. This size range should be configurable in the advanced settings page.\r\n\r\nCurrently Tox can be easily blocked.\r\n\r\nIf the app sends packets with random-looking content, with packets having different sizes and sent on different ports, it makes identification of Tox traffic very hard.\r\n",

There are several ways to do it, and changing the packet length fixes only one of them. Here are a few ways:\r\n- Detecting packet lengths. Requires a stateful firewall to recognise patterns - you can't just block all packets of length 113.\r\n- Detecting other patterns in the protocol, e.g. we have plain text public keys always in the same place in DHT packets. Also requires stateful firewall.\r\n- Block port 33445. No stateful firewall needed, just a simple UDP port block.\r\n- Block any access to any of the bootstrap nodes.

This should particularly apply to the DHT seeds.\r\n* Add the crypto library dependency supporting the public key cryptography.\r\n* If the hybrid asymmetric/symmetric encryption scheme is chosen, packet sizes should be selected with the same randomization procedure.\r\n\r\nThis can first work in parallel with the current protocol so that the transition will be seamless for the users.",

An easier way to make it look like random data is: on every packet sent to a DHT node, we create a new key pair and send the public key and nonce in plain text. Both the public key and nonce are random data. The encrypted packet following them also looks like random data. Problem solved. The issue with this is that it's computationally very expensive and it adds a bit of memory overhead.\r\n\r\nThe real question here is: is that actually necessary? This proposal protects against deep packet inspection which requires custom code specifically written to detect tox traffic. I highly doubt that China has done that. It's much more likely that they just blocked all the bootstrap nodes. Would be nice to figure that out before spending a lot of engineering time on temporary protocol fixes.",

We then need to wait for all clients to be running on the new protocol before we can start deprecating the old one. All of this is quite a lot of work even though it's pretty straightforward in theory. We have very scarce resources, and I think right now fixing this protocol issue and going through the whole protocol change workflow is not worth the time when we have another more complete protocol change coming up in a few months time. Unless we have evidence that this fix will actually help users right now, I'm reluctant to spend time on it at the moment.\r\n\r\n\\* A few person hours can already mean a full week in real time. Remember we're all volunteers doing this in our spare time next to full time jobs. Realistically, I think this change would cost at least 2-3 real time weeks to implement.",
