    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI found this source code confusingly written (and downright scary at times) and the [specification](https://toktok.github.io/spec) woefully underspecified and inexplicit, so it's entirely possible my understanding of the handshake is _inaccurate_. But on the off-chance that 5 minutes of source code review at 4am yielded something accurate, here is my understanding of the handshake:\r\n\r\nPeer A (Alice) has the longterm static keypair `(S_A^{pub}, S_A^{priv})`. Peer A has the session-generated ephemeral keypair `(E_A^{pub}, E_A^{priv})`. Peer B (Bob) has the longterm static keypair `(S_B^{pub}, S_B^{priv})`. Peer B has the session-generated ephemeral keypair `(E_B^{pub}, E_B^{priv})`.\r\n\r\nMessage 1: A -> B\r\n```\r\nXAEAD(key=ECDH(S_A^{priv}, S_B^{pub}), payload=E_A^{pub})\r\n```\r\n\r\nMessage 2: B -> A\r\n```\r\nXAEAD(key=ECDH(S_B^{priv}, S_A^{pub}), payload=E_B^{pub})\r\n```\r\n\r\nSession Key Derivation\r\n```\r\nECDH(E_A^{priv}, E_B^{pub}) = ECDH(E_B^{priv}, E_A^{pub})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this an accurate representation of the handshake? If so, keep reading. If not, you may safely stop reading here, close the issue, and accept my apologies for the misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that this naive handshake is vulnerable to key-compromise impersonation, something that basically all modern authenticated key exchanges (AKEs) are designed to protect against. Concretely, the issue is that if A's longterm static private key is stolen, an attacker can impersonate anybody to A without A realizing. Let's say that Mallory, M, has stolen A's private key and wants to pretend to be B:\r\n\r\nMessage 1: M -> A\r\n```\r\nXAEAD(key=ECDH(S_A^{priv}, S_B^{pub}), payload=E_M^{pub})\r\n```\r\n\r\nMessage 2: A -> M\r\n```\r\nXAEAD(key=ECDH(S_A^{priv}, S_B^{pub}), payload=E_A^{pub})\r\n```\r\n\r\nSession Key Derivation\r\n```\r\nECDH(E_A^{priv}, E_M^{pub}) = ECDH(E_M^{priv}, E_A^{pub})\r\n```\r\n\r\nA now thinks he is talking to B, but is actually talking to M.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Tox doesn't care about this, or about many of the threat models that modern AKEs are designed to protect against, in which case, probably it's fine to continue using your homebrewed crypto. But if you actually desire some kind of high assurance security, I strongly recommend not building your own protocols and instead use something designed by an educated expert, such as [Noise](http://noiseprotocol.org/).\r\n\r\nThis is just what immediately leaped out at me after a few short minutes of review. I haven't even begun to look at key derivation and other interesting aspects (are you guys really just using raw ECDH results as keys?).\r\n\r\nAgain, apologies if this doesn't actually represent the handshake you're using; I'm not 100% certain. But in case it does, then let this be a wake-up call to developers not to roll your own crypto, as well as a wake-up call to users not to rely on crypto software written by non-experts.",

            "body": "Hi Jason, thanks for the report. We are aware of all three issues you've mentioned, but it's great to have them written down. I'll explain a bit of background about what we're doing here, and the reasons for why issues like this have not been addressed.\r\n\r\nWe started the TokTok project about a year ago with a (now slightly outdated) [plan](https://toktok.github.io/plan). We inherited toxcore and the protocol it implements from the Tox project. We're now in some mix of phase 1 and 2, where we slowly improve the code while keeping the protocol exactly the same, with all its flaws and shortcomings. You've described one of them, but there are others. We should be more explicit about this on the website (I have filed an [issue](https://github.com/TokTok/website/issues/47) for this just now).\r\n\r\nInitially, the plan was for us to not touch toxcore at all, and instead rewrite the specification, which does contain all the information we need, just not in an obvious way. That plan relied on others working on toxcore. Since nobody would take on the toxcore part, we had to take it on ourselves, which is the main reason we're not as far along in the plan as we had initially hoped.\r\n\r\nThe new plan is roughly:\r\n\r\n1. Improve toxcore code base, not making any protocol changes, with focus on testability.\r\n2. Implement a formal model of the protocol and run equivalence tests between it and c-toxcore. This part goes together with improving the spec, since the model is the formal version of the textual spec. Up to this point, we actively ignore any design flaws and focus purely on ensuring that the implementation matches the specification.\r\n3. Publish a threat model. Implement attacks on network, random users, and specific users. Still not changing the protocol.\r\n4. Redesign the protocol and make a single cutover from old protocol to the new one.\r\n\r\nWe do have crypto experts on board, but they are very much closing their eyes to the issues most of the time. I might have more to say about this, but not in public. I'm happy to discuss in private (IRC/email/ricochet) if you're interested.\r\n\r\nI think the main action we can take related to this particular issue right now is to implement the attack. This was supposed to happen in step 3, but I don't see good reasons to keep it that far in the future. Perhaps it's a good time to publish all known attacks and their implications somewhere.",

Your website says so.).\r\n",

I've actually tried, but there is no audience for such plans.\r\n- It seems to me that the route we're taking is one that allows us to reach the goal with the starting point we inherited.\r\n\r\nI would be quite interested in your thoughts around this, and perhaps we can steer in a different direction that's better for the project.\r\n\r\n### Security properties\r\n\r\nFirst I should note the obvious, which is that exclaiming *\"X is not secure\"* is as useless a thing as saying *\"X is secure\"*. As @zx2c4 correctly said, it depends on the threat model. There are very few ways to make information transmission *secure* to every possible known and unknown attack (and then a crowbar to the wrist can break that security as well).\r\n\r\nRegarding the particular issue:\r\n- KCI depends on getting a user's secret key. If your secret key is compromised, you have several things to worry about, KCI is only one of them.\r\n- Preventing KCI in the current protocol is possible but would break deniability in the simple case.\r\n\r\nRegarding the general issue of \"oh my god tox is not secure don't use it\": this is slightly overreacting to the actual issues. As said, there are a number of possible attacks on individuals or on the network, but if secret keys remain secret, none of those attacks can compromise message content.\r\n\r\nTox provides some strong security guarantees. We haven't got to the point where we can enumerate them properly, given the general lack of understanding of the code and specification. This is the point we are currently working on: improving the code and at the same time improving our understanding of it, so that we can make large scale changes in a safe way.\r\n\r\n@zx2c4 can you point at the part of the Noise spec that explains how deniability is achieved?",

KCI is a bit more subtle than that.\r\n\r\n>  All of it sounds like concern trolling to me.\r\n\r\nNo, not really. As I wrote in the original post: if you don't actually care about having a secure protocol that meets modern expectations of an AKE, by all means defend and justify your homemade situation. However, if you're interested in gaining the trust of users and confirmation from cryptographers, you'd benefit immensely from not trying to tout the current situation as secure, but rather put up a large scary warning indicating to your users that you're working on it but that you're not there yet.\r\n\r\n> I was asking about your opinion regarding these protocols, which both provide and lack certain security properties. I am still interested in your evaluation of the importance of each of their security properties, especially wrt. a similar lack or presence of these properties in Tox. I hope we can go back to where we started: a constructive discussion. As said, we are quite aware of the situation we have inherited, and we are actively working on improving it. Your help in this endeavour would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nI think the best place to design a new crypto protocol is probably not a Github issue report. Take some time, write it out, work out the details, talk to your professors, etc. Alternatively, spend time reading existing papers and evaluating if they fit what you want and whether they have an implementation ready built for you to use. Message boards are a pretty bad place for ad-hoc design of something so critical.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll tuck out now for a little while to see how this evolves. I've done my part. There's an vuln found in 5 minutes of review. There's homebrewed crypto. There's a \"a largely undocumented, untested, and not well-understood code base of about 19 ksloc (C)\" (@iphydf). Now it's up to you how you want to handle this. Treat it as serious and worthy of a red \"do not use\" banner, if you'd like to give the impression that you care about the same standards of security that the world of cryptographers do. Carry on as usual if you simply want your thing to continue to be casually used by people who don't care _that_ much and are okay with using naive constructions.",

In standard-processes. I've been proven wrong. I've let projects go because there were better solutions out there and at a certain point one has to face the fact that one's just wasting cycles on something that's not worth the effort. It's hard if you're already engaged in something and if it's your toy. But this thread clearly outlines that you do not have sufficient resources to provide what you're aiming (and advertising) for currently.\r\n\r\nI'd put the following quote (from your post) on the webpage, I think that sums up the state of the project as far as I can tell very accurately:\r\n\r\n> Tox provides some strong security guarantees. We haven't got to the point where we can enumerate them properly, given the general lack of understanding of the code and specification.\r\n\r\nAfter June of 2013 a lot of people were eager to improve security on the internet, a lot of new messaging applications sprung up on the internet, some commercial, some open-source. Most of them turned out to be insecure in one way or the other. A few years later we can say that the clear winner is Signal and the Noise protocol. In terms of novelty, security and mass-deployment.\r\n\r\nI'd recommend taking the project/network off-line for the time being until you have a proper threat model sorted out and discussed -- in depth -- with cryptographers and engineers the protocol design you want to implement and deploy. This takes a lot of time, e.g. major networking companies hire senior/distinguished engineers just to discuss such issues in IETF, W3C and similar organizations. It's a painstaking process, and that's why protocols like OTR and TLS are still being worked on (and as some have pointed out, still have issues).\r\n\r\nIf you just want to do some good, there're a lot of projects that have been peer-reviewed and still need a lot of engineering effort, thought and love (Certbot/Let's Encrypt, LEAP, Tor, Signal, just to name a few).\r\n\r\n@kebolio \r\n> would like to mention that \"Noise\" could also be be called \"homebrewed crypto\" in that someone has actually sat down and written it. It is also Yet Another Encrypted Messaging Protocol, like there has never been enough of them (OTR, insecure Axolotl gimmick)\r\n\r\nIt is the most advanced and secure instant messaging protocol to date. This is why the designers got an award in front of a conference full of seasoned cryptographers and security engineers a week back for improving Real World Cryptography. Are you serious?\r\n\r\n@zetok \r\n> Regarding threat model: #210\r\n\r\nThis is not a threat model. I don't even understand most of the points in the table, it's not language used in security engineering or information security proper. It's confusing and does not tell a user or an engineer anything about the security properties of the protocol in it's current state.\r\n\r\nCompare with the threat model written for Certificate Transparency for example: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-trans-threat-analysis-10",

Does that seem reasonable to you?\r\n\r\nThere're a few ways to take such a project down, a simple one is not to provide working binaries to end-users anymore and make the source-code on GitHub accessible only for experts that want to play with or improve upon Tox properly (i.e. don't automate builds or something like that) - that's harsh, I know :)\r\n\r\nBeing honest about the current state of affairs is certainly the best way to approach your user-base.\r\n\r\n\r\n@fcore117 \r\n> azet: perhaps help find some crypto expert to correct issue instead of recommending to take down, if you have involved in lot of projects then maybe you have some contacts with some programming expert?\r\n\r\nIt's not only a single issue, the project as a whole seems lacking manpower, qualified security people and maintenance. I'm sorry but I cannot recommend anyone serious that would want to work on this project in it's current state. For similar projects in the commercial space there're consultants that take a lot of money to fix everything, but this isn't an option as you probably don't have funding to hire people to work on F/OSS, currently. Also I'd rather see qualified people working on and improving existing technologies that urgently need more eyes on them as they're vital to communications world-wide.\r\n\r\n@cebe \r\n> This is not true, we have just started writing a spec and making good progress.

We can not just have everything right now, it is always about iteration and improvement and this issue is something we can take to improve.\r\n\r\nYou're currently shipping an instant messaging application advertised as secure and end-to-end encrypted (most users won't know the difference), where a bored hacker found a crypto vulnerability by simply scrolling over your code. You cannot expect the community to do code-audits for you in the current state, but I'd assume if a few pairs of trained eyes were on the code the whole security of the system will fall apart within hours. There're certainly some good choices in terms of used primitives in there (NaCl for example) - just the way they are used is wrong and obviously unaudited. Also the way a lot of the code is written seems to be prone to classical vulnerabilities.\r\n",

The TokTok org has no control over the Tox Project binaries, or any others.\r\n\r\n>and make the source-code on GitHub accessible only for experts that want to play with or improve upon Tox properly (i.e. don't automate builds or something like that) - that's harsh, I know :)\r\n\r\nHow does this prevent forks? TokTok itself is just a fork. \"Shutting down\" TokTok would just prompt yet another fork, or force client developers to use a stale fork. You can rest assured that all the client developers (myself included) aren't going to throw in the towel because of a minor and fixable security flaw. \r\n\r\n>Being honest about the current state of affairs is certainly the best way to approach your user-base.\r\n\r\nYou mean like this? https://tox.chat/download.html#warning\r\n\r\nOne of the underlying design principles of Tox was to make it impervious to centralized control. This applies both to the network itself, and the development process. No person or organization has control over the network, nor development. In light of this fact, your options are:\r\n\r\n1. Help\r\n2. Don't help\r\n\r\nAttempts to discourage or demoralize the development team from furthering the project have been ongoing since day one, and in my experience it's a counterproductive strategy. ",

I was very happy to find a solution some weeks ago in tox - which is easy to install and use on different operating systems. I don't care about a 0,001% chance of beeing hacked, and this is what all users do. If you are Julien Assange and need a super secure vehicle, then you will find one. For normal users that are fed up with the commercialisation of skype, whatsapp and others, this application is totally sufficient! I am highly disturbed by the people suggesting to shut the project down, or even about making big remarks about \"insecurity\". This is a very egocentric point of view. It feels like you are trying to sabotage this awesome project. If your so smart to review the code in five minutes and find big problems, go solve them by actually contributing code! ",

They key derivation, encryption, message authentication etc are all from NaCl. As far as I can tell, the KCI vulnerability is a fundamental and probably unavoidable property of NaCl's authenticated encryption; possession of one party's private key is by design sufficient to forge messages from either party to the other. This is sort-of documented at https://nacl.cr.yp.to/box.html in the context of repudiability, but the KCI issue isn't mentioned and the proposed solution provides non-repudiation which is undesirable here. If this is really serious enough that it justifies a big red disclaimer, then presumably Daniel J Bernstein should add a similar one to the documentation for crypto_box, especially given how widely recommended it is as an easy, secure and misuse-resistant crypto solution.",

            "body": "Protocols aren't primitives. Secure primitives certainly do not imply secure\r\nprotocols (Example: AES is a secure block cipher, but AES-ECB is clearly not a\r\nsecure way to encrypt messages). Secure protocols mostly imply secure\r\nprimitives. (Counterexample: a protocol using HMAC-MD5 doesn't have forgery\r\nissues even though MD5 is not a secure hash function.)\r\n\r\nThere are several levels of \"homebrew\" of \"roll-your-own\" cryptography:\r\n\r\n- Designing your own block ciphers or hash functions.\r\n- Designing your own compositions of primitives, like AE or MAC.\r\n- Designing your own protocols, like TLS or Noise. \r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists on that third level. As a consequence, this isn't a\r\nrepudiation of NaCl or libsodium. They're excellent libraries. Curve25519 is a\r\nDH primitive, and there's no DH vulnerability here. The problem is that it's not\r\nan AKE, and that's what you're using it as. The docs clearly enumerate what it\r\ndoes and does not do:\r\n\r\n    Security model\r\n\r\n    crypto_scalarmult is designed to be strong as a component of various\r\n    well-known \"hashed Diffie–Hellman\" applications. In particular, it is\r\n    designed to make the \"computational Diffie–Hellman\" problem (CDH) difficult\r\n    with respect to the standard base.\r\n    \r\n    crypto_scalarmult is also designed to make CDH difficult with respect to\r\n    other nontrivial bases. In particular, if a represented group element has\r\n    small order, then it is annihilated by all represented scalars. This feature\r\n    allows protocols to avoid validating membership in the subgroup generated by\r\n    the standard base.\r\n\r\n    NaCl does not make any promises regarding the \"decisional Diffie–Hellman\"\r\n    problem (DDH), the \"static Diffie–Hellman\" problem (SDH), etc. Users are\r\n    responsible for hashing group elements.\r\n\r\nFor example, this clearly states that you're responsible for hashing group\r\nelements, which ostensibly the Tox AKE does not do. If you build an AKE, there\r\nare other documented aspects of Curve25519 to consider; for example, some AKE\r\nprotocols require contributory behavior, which means that in Curve25519 you're\r\n(exceptionally) required to consider representations of points of low order (see\r\nhttps://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html).\r\n\r\nThe claim that libsodium doesn't give you the tools to produce a secure AKE is\r\nincorrect. Firstly, you can do a traditional signing key exchanges. Secondly,\r\nNoise is a proof from construction; there are implementations of the Noise\r\nprotocol available on the site, and you'll see that it defines a KCI-secure AKE\r\nthat you can implement using nothing but NaCl/libsodium.\r\n\r\nFinally, as much as I try to draw this conversation away from individuals and\r\ntowards technical discussion, I hope you'll find that I've tried pretty hard\r\nboth here and in general to provide constructive contributions, and trying to\r\neducate those who'll listen. And, I tell people to consult a cryptographer,\r\nalthough you could do a lot worse than NaCl as a set of solid primitives :)\r\n\r\nIf a chainsaw does a bad job of cutting an apple, it's not a bad chainsaw.",

            "body": "I'll respond to a few small obvious things I've seen since I left the thread alone yesterday.\r\n\r\n### @irungentoo's hubris / \"KCI ain't that bad\"\r\n> You are fucked if you get your key stolen. There are so many more fun things you can do if you steal someones key that I simply didn't bother trying to handle that case because it would not provide any actual security.\r\n\r\nThis isn't as true for modern AKEs, which give pretty nice security properties that your handrolled naiveté just doesn't account for. How so, you ask?\r\n\r\n- Compromise one key, A, with Tox AKE --> mount an active man in the middle attack on an infinite quantity of keypairs `(A, {everybody else})`.\r\n- Compromise one key, A, with modern mutual AKE --> man in the middle attack not feasible.\r\n- Compromise two keys, A & B, with modern mutual AKE --> man in the middle attack feasible between one keypair `(A, B)`.\r\n\r\nSo, if you quantify it this way, in terms of \"number of full man in the middle attacks feasible after compromising N keys\", a modern mutual AKE is _infinity times_ better than the Tox AKE.\r\n\r\nIf you're serious about doing things right, you wouldn't hubristically categorize things as \"any actual security\" so hastily, when in fact there's a massive body of research and human accomplishment that's preceded your novice crypto. Open your eyes. Read some papers. Humble yourself while looking at your species, in awe of the wonderful cryptographic techniques created before you. So you made a mistake. We all do. Time to educate yourself and improve now.\r\n\r\n### \"Since we use NaCl, we must be safe, unless DJB is an idiot!\"\r\n\r\nMaking a protocol is different from using safe primitives. There are dragons at every step in the process. NaCl came with an implementation of CurveCP -- a protocol -- which exists accessibly as [`libchloride`](https://github.com/jedisct1/libchloride). Are you using `libchloride`? No you're not. So not only do you fail to use NaCl in a safe way, but you fail to use the protocl that NaCl says is safe!\r\n\r\n### \"It's still more safe than cleartext or Skype\"\r\n\r\nMaybe true (if you ignore the C implementation vulnerabilities in toxcore), but there are easily accessible things more secure than Tox that actually use modern cryptography, rather than Tox's handrolled non-peer-reviewed no-security-model drivel. So it seems obvious to recommend that you use those actually secure protocols instead. When folks expect for the word \"secure\" to indicate what cryptographers consider acceptable, using \"secure\" for something like Tox is disingenuous and even potentially dangerous.\r\n\r\n### \"I'm confused and don't understand KCI; my analogies are incorrect!\"\r\n\r\nProbably this discussion is not for you, then. Also, you probably shouldn't be developing cryptographic software in that case.\r\n\r\n### \"Cryptographers are a secret Illuminati club\"\r\n\r\nNo they're not. They're just people who took the time to study and actively engage in peer review and open constructive criticism.\r\n\r\n### \"We'll never quit! Help us, or get lost! You can't break our spirits!\"\r\n\r\nIt's not really about that. By all means, continue to develop software and expand your experience and education, in private. But publicly releasing and promoting software with known fundamental insecurities is irresponsible and reckless.\r\n\r\n### \"But we can't just take down the network because it's a DHT\"\r\n\r\nYou can remove code repositories, pre-built binaries, websites (contacting the owners of tox.{im,chat}), etc. You can also add big red disclaimers \"DO NOT USE - EXPERIMENTAL & INSECURE\" to every medium you have.\r\n\r\n### @iphydf's admissions\r\n\r\n> We have a largely undocumented, untested, and not well-understood code base of about 19 ksloc (C).\r\n> Tox provides some strong security guarantees. We haven't got to the point where we can enumerate them properly, given the general lack of understanding of the code and specification.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the honesty here. It's also a pretty good indication that you should start from scratch. Determine what security goals you want; then develop software around them. The fact that nobody understands the code, the crypto, or the protocol all but admits complete failure. You can't guarantee something if you don't know what you're guaranteeing, or the mechanism by which this guarantee is brought about. You admitted this yourself -- that because you don't understand Tox, \"any change we make has the potential to make Tox less secure, running counter to our goal.\"\r\n\r\n### Heeding to advice\r\n\r\nYou've got cryptographers and security experts telling you to shutdown and take a more conservative approach. Your reaction has been one of pride and stubbornness. Yes, you've worked very hard on this and it's your baby so you want to keep it. But responsibility is something important. Providing software that does not provide adequate security under the label of \"secure software\" is dishonest and irresponsible. The webpage touts Tox as \"VERY secure\", which it clearly is not.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't have to do with sabotage or demoralization. It's about responsibility.\r\n\r\nHang up the red \"we're only an experiment\" banners, or abandon ship.",

I assume you care about crypto, and about teaching how to use it correctly. I'll just hit the broad points.\r\n\r\n> There are several levels of \"homebrew\" of \"roll-your-own\" cryptography:\r\n\r\nRight, but would you dissagree that, among the security/crypto circles. It's use derogatorily to reference shit code written by someone with no idea what they're doing? So unless you're trying to imply that the original author fucked up, don't you think it becomes a bit problematic, if not outright insulting? \r\n\r\nAlso, It's doesn't even apply in this case. We're not even rolling our own crypto. An argument can be made that we're created a \"crypto system\". But that's even a hard sell, given we're using the NaCl API as the documentation instructs.\r\n\r\n> The claim that libsodium doesn't give you the tools to produce a secure AKE is\r\nincorrect. \r\n\r\nI must have missed that part of the NaCl documentation. As NaCl compatibility was one of the original design goals for Toxcore. (While I'm here, I'm also going to mention again that tox.chat already warns users not to get their key stolen. If you'd like to have a separate discussion on the merits of THAT warning. We should open a new issue) Also, let's remind everyone that @irungentoo, the original author of the codebase was aware of the attack verctor, and decided not to include it as a part of the threat model.  \r\n\r\n> Noise is a proof from construction; there are implementations of the Noise\r\nprotocol available on the site, and you'll see that it defines a KCI-secure AKE\r\nthat you can implement using nothing but NaCl/libsodium.\r\n\r\nLink, the Noise stuff I saw didn't really offer ANY documentation. But then I never looked THAT hard.\r\n\r\n> Finally, as much as I try to draw this conversation away from individuals and\r\n> towards technical discussion, I hope you'll find that I've tried pretty hard\r\n> both here and in general to provide constructive contributions, and trying to\r\n> educate those who'll listen. And, I tell people to consult a cryptographer,\r\n> although you could do a lot worse than NaCl as a set of solid primitives :)\r\n\r\nYou've been awesome, as I said at the start, you're always welcome around here. (Hopefully you'll hit up HN again and answer my pending question to you)\r\n\r\n> If a chainsaw does a bad job of cutting an apple, it's not a bad chainsaw.\r\n\r\nRight, but if you then call up the chainsaw maker, and shit all over the work they've done. They're allowed to be offended. ",

We will fix this issue, most likely by adopting Noise for handshakes.\r\n\r\nI will post one more message on this issue and then lock it. Please contact me (my github email is public and I'm usually on IRC: iphy @ freenode) if you feel this decision is inappropriate. I am keeping this issue open until it is solved.",

The property you're describing is slightly different than \"non-repudiation\" (a property of signatures, which is one way to get KCI), instead you want \"deniability\", which other protocols offer. Deniability in this case means that the receiver can authenticate the sender, but the receiver can not convince anyone else that the actual sender must be the sender of a given message. (This is different still from \"indistinguishability\", which means different things in different context, but in this context specifically it would usually mean that a passive network observer can't tell that you're speaking $PROTOCOL.)\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "@horusra \r\nYes, there is an update to this issue. \r\n\r\nI wrote my master thesis on “Adopting the Noise key exchange in Tox”. You can download the full master thesis from here: https://pub.fh-campuswien.ac.at/obvfcwhsacc/content/titleinfo/5430137\r\n\r\nI presented the results of my master thesis at Remote Chaos Experience (rC3): https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-709912-adopting_the_noise_key_exchange_in_tox \r\nTalk slides are available here: https://pretalx.rc3.studio/media/rc3-channels-2020/submissions/PWNJYW/resources/Buchberger_ToxNoise_rC3_0zhUC7T.pdf \r\n\r\nAs @zx2c4 wrote in the initial post, the handshake is not easy to understand based on the existing spec and implementation. My thesis includes a detailed description of Tox’ handshake, including the (KCI-vulnerable) authenticated key exchange (AKE), all exchanged messages and all performed computations (see chapter 2.4). Hopefully this will be used for further security analysis.\r\n\r\nThe DHT key pairs, which are used to calculate a shared secret in the cookie phase of the Tox handshake, make an actual KCI-attack on the Tox’ AKE more complicated than the simplified description from @zx2c4. This is because\r\n\r\n- M needs to obtain the X25519 static private key  `S_A^{priv}` from A to impersonate B to A\r\n- M needs to obtain the X25519 static public key from B (`S_B^{pub}` or B’s Tox ID) to be able to impersonate them to A\r\n- A and B need to be online at the same time because the attacker is not able to initiate a handshake on their own due to the usage of a shared secret based on the DHT key pairs during the cookie phase of the handshake. If it’s possible for M to spoof B’s DHT key pair, M could initiate a handshake on their own. I didn’t have time to look at the DHT module during my thesis, therefore I’m not sure if this is possible.\r\n- The attacker needs to have control over the network between A and B (i.e. the internet -> NSA-style) to be able to intercept and drop packets\r\n- The attacker would need to reimplement toxcore because it's not possible to exploit KCI by using the \"normal\" toxcore \r\n\r\nAnyway, this vulnerability should be fixed. I created a PoC implementation which is based on the Noise-C library: https://github.com/goldroom/c-toxcore/tree/tb_noise_handshake_IK_noise_patch \r\nThe PoC implementation in it’s current state shouldn’t be used in practice. Also it’s not backwards compatible. \r\n\r\nI added AKE-related comments to `net_crypto.c`, hopefully they are also helpful for other people to gather more understanding of Tox’ handshake implementation. \r\n\r\nIn future work the Noise IK pattern should be implemented directly in toxcore instead of using Noise-C (cf. Wireguard). \r\n\r\nMaybe @lvh is also interested in this update.\r\n",
